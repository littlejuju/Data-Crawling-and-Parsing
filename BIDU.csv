1,"[""Hello, everyone. Baidu's third quarter revenues reached RMB 28.1 billion,\nabove the midpoint of our guidance with Baidu Core performing better than our\noriginal expectations. Baidu Core revenues grew 8% sequentially in the third\nquarter, on top of the 12% sequential growth in the second quarter. In spite\nof the slowing macro environment, industry-specific policy changes and self-\ndirected health care initiative. Baidu Core's quarterly sequential growth\nrates, compared to last year's second and third quarter of 26% and 9%,\nrespectively, excluding spinoff revenues, have been narrowing. Our marketing\nservice business is improving in part due to a stabilizing market as well as\nour efforts to strengthen our mobile ecosystem and our monetization\ncapabilities.\n\nWe have made significant progress in strengthening Baidu's mobile ecosystem,\ncentering around information and knowledge. We continue to push the limits of\nBaidu AI to better match users to the vast and diversified content pool in\nBaidu App. Our Top-1 satisfying user queries with the first search result has\nreached 56% compared to 40% a year ago.\n\nOn top of leading search and a comprehensive set of knowledge-based products,\nBaidu App provides hosted solutions such as Baijiahao, or BJH account, smart\nmini program and Managed Page to publishers, app developers and HTML5 site\nowners to offer a wide range of third-party content and services in Baidu App\nwith native app-like experience. Our efforts to strengthen Baidu's mobile\necosystem with hosted solutions add a high level of barrier to entry to in-app\nsearch while presenting Baidu with newsfeed and short video opportunities.\nBaidu's cutting-edge AI technologies plus hosted solutions are leading to a\nbetter search and feed experience, which is drawing many users to log in on\nBaidu App.\n\nIn the third quarter, we began to unify our mobile pillars, BJH, smart mini\nprogram, Managed Page and CRM, onto a hosted marketing platform to allow our\ncustomers to build brand, engage with users and grow audience. Our hosted\nmarketing platform leverages Baidu's technologies and user insight to enable\nSMEs and KAs to perform user relationship management. In August, we made\navailable a toolkit of over 300 web creative content templates on our hosted\nplatform, and now, Managed Page owners can significantly streamline their app\ncreative process with the toolkit. We also released a toolkit to our customers\nto enable users who see their ads complete a lead generation form with just\none click. By offering a hosted marketing platform that can be continuously\nupgraded with Baidu technologies, our customers can focus on the marketing\nrather than the IT aspect of their campaigns, which will make Baidu's\nmarketing services more compelling.\n\nWe also made great progress in Baidu's new AI businesses and in improving our\noperational efficiencies, which Herman will elaborate later on.\n\nOn search and feed, in September, Baidu App daily active users continued to\nsee robust growth, reaching 189 million. That's up 25% year-over-year.\nMomentum for in-app traffic remains strong, with in-app search queries growing\nover 25% year-over-year; feed time spent, up 16% year-over-year; and feed plus\nshort video app time spent, up 35% year-over-year. On top of rapid traffic\ngrowth, user log in has been growing now accounting more than half of Baidu\nApp's daily active users.\n\nBJH now hosts 2.4 million publisher accounts, up 57% year-over-year. BJH\nallows our publishers to get the optimal exposure in Baidu Search. Our efforts\nto improve content quality and emphasize the social aspects of BJH have\nboosted traffic and user engagement. In September, content sharing was up 29%\nyear-over-year, while usage of like functions grow 89% year-over-year.\n\nOur knowledge-based products, including Baidu Wiki, Baidu Knows, Baidu\nExperience and Baidu Wenku, have accumulated over 1 billion content pieces,\nincluding articles, videos, etc, collaboratively produced with users,\nprofessionals and institutions. Our focus to enrich Baidu's knowledge content\nhas led to a significant increase in user engagement. For example, in\nSeptember, daily user time spent on Baidu knowledge content in Baidu family of\napps grow 41%, while daily video views, including Baidu Wiki and Baidu\nExperience, increased 36% as compared to June.\n\nBaidu's smart mini program is seeing great traffic momentum with MAUs reaching\n290 million in September, up 157% year-over-year. And 1/4 of Baidu's in-app\nuser clicks from search results were fulfilled by the information and services\nfrom Baidu's smart mini program. In addition, in the last 3 months, the number\nof smart mini programs more than doubled, while user time spent on Baidu's\nsmart mini program grew 32%.\n\nWe are excited to see app developers adopting Baidu's smart mini programs as a\nkey channel for user acquisition and to deepen customer engagement. By\nleveraging Baidu's intent-based traffic, hosted marketing platform and smart\nmini program's closed-loop features, our partners can continuously improve\ntraffic growth and conversion through user relationship management on Baidu.\nFor example, a well-known e-commerce company in China used Baidu's smart mini\nprogram to give away coupons to users, leveraging Baidu's user insight, and\nsaw its conversion improve 2.5 times over HTML5 pages.\n\nThe adoption of Baidu's smart mini program is also helping our customers\nbroaden their spectrum of marketing options. A leading K-12 after-school\ntutoring provider used their Baidu's smart mini program to allow users who see\ntheir ads automate the completion of sales lead forms for trial classes with\none click, for user authorization. By hosting the traffic on Baidu's platform,\nthe education company improved its marketing ROI by 30% compared to its HTML5\nsite.\n\nBy connecting to Baidu's platform through an SDK or through hosting on Baidu\nCloud, Baidu's smart mini program partners can leverage the advanced\ntechnology and user insight provided by Baidu's tool kits.\n\nTurning to Managed Page. Better user experience and ad conversion are leading\nto the adoption of our Managed Page. Revenue from Managed Page in the third\nquarter accounted for nearly 1/5 of Baidu Core's marketing revenue.\n\nWe are adding more benefits for SMEs to move to Managed Page. In August, we\nreleased a toolkit on Baidu's hosted marketing platform with over 300 content\ncreative templates, which makes it easier for SMEs from all industries to\nmigrate their H5 sites to Baidu's Managed Page.\n\nIn the health care area, we're seeing our customers use more video content on\ntheir Managed Page to provide health care information to users compared to the\noriginal H5 site. Managed Pages are hosted on Baidu Cloud, which is typically\nmore stable and provides a smoother experience for video broadcasting than the\nIT infrastructure SMEs usually purchase on their own.\n\nManaged Page can also improve conversion. For example, a driving school in\nXi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, saw an 80% lift in lead conversions\ncompared to its own H5 site by using the online chat and live call\nconsultation tool kit from Baidu's hosted marketing platform with its Managed\nPage.\n\nAccording to CNNIC, there are approximately 5 million websites in China, and\nmost of them do not have the resources nor capabilities to leverage AI and\nother leading technologies to improve their marketing effectiveness. By\njoining Baidu's Managed Page and using our hosted marketing platform, SMEs can\ncontinuously improve traffic growth and marketing conversion in light of the\nslowing overall mobile traffic growth in China.\n\nTurning to monetization. We have expanded oCPX for newsfeed to oCPX for\nPhoenix Nest, our search monetization platform, to allow SMEs to purchase P4P\nmarketing services based on a cost-per-action basis most suitable for their\nindustry, such as on a cost-per-lead, cost-per-download or cost-per-purchase\nbasis. By knowing what the return will be in advance based on the metrics that\nour customers care about, oCPX now can improve marketing ROI certainty for\nsearch on the backdrop of current macro uncertainties. In the third quarter,\nad spending on oCPX grew fourfold, and average cost per action decreased over\n10% year-on-year.\n\nIn summary, we are building a comprehensive and diversified mobile ecosystem\ncentered around information and knowledge with Baijiahao, smart mini program\nand Managed Page as important pillars. Our hosted solutions enable publishers,\napp developers and customers to share their content, information and services\non Baidu's platform with native app-like experience, which is translating into\nrobust traffic growth for Baidu App and providing a foundation for us to\nenable our customers and partners to grow through the use of Baidu’s\ntechnologies.\n\nMoving to DuerOS. In the third quarter, DuerOS voice assistant continues to\ngrow fast, with monthly voice queries surpassing 4.2 billion in September, up\nover 4.5-fold year-over-year. DuerOS is gaining strong momentum in the Chinese\nmarket due to our relentless focus on user experience. We strive to upgrade\nfeatures in DuerOS to make voice assistant friendlier to use. For example,\nDuerOS for Xiaodu Smart Display can now respond to hand gestures to stop\nplaying music when one hears a phone call, for instance, and make full-duplex\ncontinued conversation or multi-round conversation without wake words through\neye gesture detection.\n\nTurning to DuerOS first-party devices. While our goal for DuerOS smart\nspeakers is not necessarily to be #1, meaning, hardware sales, Xiaodu smart\nspeakers continue to see strong sales momentum. Leading market research firms\nCanalys, Strategy Analytics and IDC ranked Xiaodu series speakers #1 in smart\nspeaker shipments in China for the second quarter. According to Canalys, Baidu\novertook Google in the second quarter to become #2 globally in smart speaker\nshipment, while IDC reported that Xiaodu Smart Display ranked first in smart\ndisplay shipment globally in the second quarter. We believe it is important\nfor Xiaodu smart speakers to maintain a large market share because scale will\nallow us to build brand, increase pricing power and reduce unit cost.\n\nWe are differentiating Xiaodu smart speakers through Baidu AI capabilities and\nthe breadth of service offerings provided by DuerOS skills store. We are\nexcited by the opportunity to monetize DuerOS smart speakers through\nmembership, advertising, skills store revenue share as we test trial different\nmonetization options over the next year.\n\nOn Apollo, we are excited about our progress in early-stage commercialization\nof smart transportation, especially in terms of forming strategic partnerships\nwith municipal governments across China and helping bigger cities improve\ntransportation, traffic safety and air quality using Baidu AI.\n\nIn September, China's first robotaxi pilot program was made available to the\npublic with an initial fleet of 45 Apollo-powered autonomous vehicles roaming\nthe streets of Changsha, the capital city of the Hunan Province. Hundreds of\npassengers in the city of Changsha experienced Apollo-powered robotaxi fleet\nin the first 30 days. Initial feedback has been quite positive. Changsha's\nrobotaxi pilot program leverages Baidu's V2X solution which sends signals on\ntraffic lights and close-proximity traffic condition to Apollo-powered\nvehicles, overcoming blind spots and improving traffic efficiency and safety.\n\nOn cloud, at the Baidu Cloud ABC Summit in August, new AI enterprise solutions\nwere introduced to optimize visual, speech processing and other AI\ncapabilities to help customers increase productivity and improve operational\nefficiency. For example, Baidu Cloud released an AI-powered video editing\nsolution that can automate the tedious task of cutting films into video clips\nand tagging them while the film is broadcasted live. The official website of\nChina's largest TV station, CCTV.com, used Baidu Cloud video editing AI\nsolution during the live broadcasting of China's 70th anniversary celebration\non October 1 and saw its video editing efficiency gain by roughly 10 times.\n\nBaidu Cloud also released an extension of its AI call center enterprise\nsolution, which Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, or SPD Bank, is using to\ndevelop its virtual customer service representative, called Xiaopu. Xiaopu\nwill appear in SPD Bank's mobile app carrying human-like expressions as it\ninteracts with SPD customers as a virtual assistant. We see such call center\nsolution extension applicable to industries beyond the financial services,\nsuch as telecommunication, media and education.\n\nTo encourage the usage of Baidu AI and Baidu Cloud services, we continue to\nimprove Baidu's AI technologies and make them available on Baidu's AI Open\nPlatform, which saw user growth in the third quarter with developer membership\nmore than doubling from last year to over 1.5 million.\n\nIn September, Baidu Maps enhanced its voice feature with Baidu leading voice\nsynthesis technology, allowing users to customize the voice feature on Baidu\nMaps with user's own voice by recording just 20 sentences. Over 280 million\nBaidu users have used the Baidu Maps voice feature as of September, doubling\nfrom the previous year.\n\nTurning to iQIYI. iQIYI continues its solid membership growth with subscribers\nreaching 105.8 million in September, up 31% year-over-year. iQIYI's strong\nmembership growth further strengthens its foundation as a leading video\nplatform in China, self-producing long-form videos series, and as an important\nvideo partner of Baidu's search plus feed ecosystem.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Herman to go through the financial\nhighlights.\n"", ""Alicia, this is Robin. I think our strategy has not changed very much. Our\ncore business, which is the Baidu mobile ecosystem, centered around search and\nfeed, is a knowledge- and information-based mobile ecosystem, and we're\nleading in this part in China. Using the pillars like Baijiahao, smart mini\nprogram and Managed Page, we are fostering a healthier and stronger ecosystem,\nand this will continue to be the highest priority for Baidu. As our\nexperiences in the Baidu mobile ecosystem continue to improve, we do not have\nto spend as much money to buy traffic as before. So that's one of the reasons\nyou see the margin improving on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nAnd going forward, we think there are still a lot of things to do in the\nmobile ecosystem area, and we will continue to innovate and provide a better\nand different user experience than the industry peers in China.\n\nAnd on the AI-enabled new businesses, we think all are very promising. And\nDuerOS, we think we are the very clear leader in the conversational AI space.\nIt has cost us a lot of money in the past, but going forward, I think the\noverall loss will continue to narrow for the next 1 or 2 years.\n\nOn Apollo, it's morphing into more like a smart transportation total solution\nbecause most of the Chinese cities are very keen to work with us and improve\ntheir transportation infrastructure.\n\nCloud is more generic, and we strive to leverage our AI capabilities to grow\nmarket share in areas that we are good at.\n\nAnd for travel, I think we are still very committed to partner with Trip.com.\nAnd we are continuing to work closely with them on all fronts within our\nmobile ecosystem as well as with our AI capabilities.\n"", ""Okay. I'll answer your first question, and Herman will answer the second one.\nOn the first, I think because we continue to improve the user experience for\nBaidu App and we also try to direct users from third-party browser to the\nBaidu App, we've seen strong traffic growth of our in-app search where users\nget much better experience. So there's going to be a virtuous circle for this\nkind of user behavior.\n\nAnd the disparity between traffic growth and revenue growth is that we\nbasically explained all the headwinds, industry-specific regulations, self-\nenforced discipline in certain industries like health care and macro. We also\nthink that we need to improve our self-management system. So this thing, I\nthink, will be temporary, and we're also seeing the macro environment\nstabilizing. So we do think that, eventually, the revenue will catch up with\nthe traffic.\n"", ""Yes, I think we have 2 major challenges. One is on the mobile side. As many of\nyou know, a lot of the large mobile apps are very much a closed ecosystem. So\nit's not easy for us to index every piece of content as we did during the PC\nera. So what we are trying to do is to build our own mobile ecosystem so that\ncontent and services can be more native to the Baidu ecosystem. I think\nalthough these are the challenges, but these are also opportunities.\n\nOnce we can build a healthy and strong mobile ecosystem, the user experience\nwill be more indigenous, meaning that our users get better experience, and our\ncustomers expect better conversion. We are in the process of transitioning. So\nthat's why you see that traffic, probably, a leading indicator that is\ngrowing, but the revenue side or the monetization side has not picked up that\nsignificantly. So going forward, we are continuing to push on the mobile\necosystem, in fact, with all of our organically built content and services.\n\nAnd on the AI side, I think that the main challenge is that the market does\nnot grow as fast as some would expect. So that's why we still need to continue\nto invest in this kind of new initiatives and waiting for the market to become\nmore mature so that we will be able to profit from that.\n"", ""Yes, on the demand side, I think, as I mentioned, overall, we are seeing signs\nof stabilization, which means it's not getting worse. As we actually build a\nmore solid and user-friendly mobile ecosystem, we would all be able to\ngradually get back the advertising budgets. And on the supply side, there has\nbeen a sudden flash of new app inventories over the past year or so. We see\nthat kind of speed of increase slowing down, so that is also kind of good for\nus. But ultimately, we focus on our own strengths, building the best mobile\necosystem for knowledge and information, therefore, we can provide unique\nvalue to our customers and advertisers. The initiatives we talked about during\nthe prepared remarks all resulted in better conversion for our customers.\nBecause the mainstream of our revenues are basically pay for performance, as\nlong as we can continue to improve the performance, we will be able to get\nmore budget from our customers.\n\nAnd for 5G, I think that will give us more opportunities to innovate in a lot\nof fronts. On the mobile side, I think the video product features will\ncontinue to evolve, and it could be very different from what we see today. And\non the AI2B side, smart transport transportation, smart manufacturing,\neducation, in fact, we see opportunities to transform those business models in\nall kinds of different areas and industries.\n"", ""Let me answer the competition question. I think search has a very high barrier\nto entry, and –it takes a long time in the user behavior having formed. So\nit's not that easy to change user behavior from a browsing habit to a search\nhabit because for browsing, users do not need to do much, so it's easier to do\nbrowsing. If you ask someone to transform from an easier-to-do thing to a\nharder-to-do thing, that's not that easy. But on the other end, if you want to\ntransform those users who are used to search, who are used to typing or\nexpress their needs explicitly to a browsing behavior, that's much easier. So\nthat's why it's easier for Baidu to do feed, but it's harder for a feed player\nto do search.\n\nAnd on top of that, I think the technology barrier to search is very high. If\nyou can solve the search problem, you basically solve the AGI (artificial\ngeneral intelligence) problem, because whatever the users say, you have to be\nable to understand that and come up with relevant results, which requires a\nlot of research, a lot of investment, and it's a very hard problem.\n""]",Robin Li,"Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO"
2,"[""Thanks, Robin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Baidu's third quarter 2019 call.\nAll monetary amounts used in our discussion are in renminbi unless stated\notherwise.\n\nTotal revenues for the third quarter reached CNY 28.1 billion, or USD 3.93\nbillion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding spin off revenues, and up 7% quarter-\nover-quarter. Revenue from Baidu Core was CNY 21 billion, or USD 2.94 billion,\nup 2% year-over-year, excluding spin off revenues, and up 8% quarter-over-\nquarter. Marketing Services revenue saw strength from education, retail and\nservices sectors and were offset by weakness in health care, financial\nservices, franchising and auto sectors. As Robin mentioned, we are seeing a\nstabilizing market in general.\n\nOur new AI businesses, including DuerOS smart devices and Baidu Cloud,\ncontinue to see fast growth, which in total grew over 100% year-over-year.\nXiaodu smart speakers saw a robust growth, and the unit economics are\nimproving through price increases and reduction in cost of goods sold. Baidu\nCloud revenue for the third quarter was up over 70% year-over-year as we\nplaced more emphasis on project margins. Going forward, we will not disclose\nBaidu Cloud revenue separately each quarter. Revenue scale, margins and\npricing are sensitive information in the highly competitive markets of smart\nspeakers, cloud and other AI businesses.\n\niQIYI revenue reached CNY 7.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Membership\nrevenue continued to see strong growth, up 30% year-over-year, and iQIYI's ad\nbusiness was down 14% year-over-year due to slowing macro, delay of top\ncontent launches and heavy competition from in-feed advertising.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA reached CNY 5.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 18%.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core reached CNY 7.5 billion, or USD 1.05 billion.\nAnd adjusted EBITDA margin for Baidu Core reached 36% compared to 24% from\nlast quarter.\n\nOn a sequential basis, Baidu Core revenue grew CNY 1.5 billion, while Baidu\nCore adjusted EBITDA increased CNY 2.8 billion. Our disciplined approach to\nspending coupled with the traction that we have made in strengthening Baidu's\nmobile ecosystem have allowed Baidu Core sequential revenue increase to\nbasically fall to the bottom line, while our cost management initiatives have\ncontributed to the sequential decrease of over CNY 1 billion in Baidu Core's\ncosts and expenses. We continue to invest heavily for the future, and our\ndisciplined approach puts an emphasis on investment and return.\n\nIn our GAAP numbers, net loss attributable to Baidu was CNY 6.4 billion, which\nincluded a noncash impairment loss of CNY 8.9 billion in total other loss. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2015, following a transaction where we exchanged shares\nof our majority-owned subsidiary Qunar for a minority investment in Trip.com,\nwe deconsolidated Qunar, recorded investment into Ctrip.com at the closing-\ndate market value and recognized a non-cash accounting gain of CNY 24.4\nbillion.\n\nSince then, the market value of Trip.com shares have declined, and the\ncontinued low market price has caused us to recognize a noncash impairment\nloss of CNY 8.9 million in the third quarter, which was determined other than\ntemporary. In October 2019, we sold down our holding in Trip.com, which\ndecreased from approximately 19% to over 12% of Trips.com's outstanding\nshares.\n\nLet me quickly go over the rest of the financial highlights.\n\nTurning to cost of sales. Excluding stock compensation and intangible asset\namortization, cost of sales was CNY 16.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\nBandwidth and depreciation cost increased primarily due to robust growth of\nour cloud business and increased video consumption, while cost of goods sold\nincreased primarily from the sales increase in Xiaodu smart speakers. TAC\nincreased 5% year-over-year as a result of higher TAC prices expansion into\nconnected off-line screens and other areas.\n\nSG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 4.3 billion, down 15%\nyear-over-year, primarily due to the decrease in channel and promotional\nmarketing as less marketing spending met our stringent ROI criteria. The\ndecrease in marketing spending has hampered the sequential traffic growth of\nour apps, including Haokan short video and Quanmin flash video. We will\ncontinue to manage our marketing dollars with a strong discipline toward\ninvestment return while recognizing that our marketing investments may not\nprovide a return in the same quarter that the expense was incurred.\n\nR&D expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 3.9 billion, up 18% year-\nover-year, primarily due to increased personnel expenses, particularly for AI\ndevelopment.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income was CNY 3.7 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin\nwas 13% compared to 7% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income for Baidu Core\nwas CNY 6.2 billion or USD 871 million. And non-GAAP operating margin for\nBaidu Core reached 30% in the third quarter compared to 18% last quarter.\n\nIncome tax expense was CNY 934 million compared to CNY 2.1 billion in the same\nquarter last year. Income tax expense in the third quarter included a tax\nwithholding for potential dividend distribution to offshore entities.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu was CNY 4.4 billion, and non-GAAP\nnet margin was 16%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu Core was CNY 6.3\nbillion or USD 883 million. Non-GAAP net margin for Baidu Core was 30%\ncompared to 24% last quarter.\n\nAs of September 30, 2019, cash and short-term investments was CNY 137.4\nbillion or USD 19.2 billion. Excluding iQIYI, cash and short-term investments\nfor Baidu Core was CNY 123.5 billion or USD 17.3 billion.\n\nFree cash flow was CNY 7.6 billion, and free cash flow for Baidu Core was CNY\n7.5 billion or USD 1 billion. Total full-time equivalent of Baidu Core was\napproximately 30,300.\n\nTurning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect total revenue to be between CNY\n27.1 billion and CNY 28.7 billion, representing a minus 1% to 6% increase\nyear-over-year. Our guidance assumes Baidu Core revenue will grow between 0%\nto 6% year-over-year.\n\nThese forecasts are our current and preliminary view and are subject to\nchange.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, let me recap Baidu's third\nquarter results.\n\nBaidu's search and feed business is making great progress. Baidu App traffic\nremains strong as we expand Baidu's mobile ecosystem centering around\ninformation and knowledge and improve user experience with mobile pillars,\nincluding BJH accounts, smart mini program and Managed Page.\n\nOur monetization capabilities are strengthening with Baidu's hosted marketing\nplatform and expansion of our monetization products, such as oCPX for search.\n\nBaidu's revenues for the third quarter was higher than the midpoint of our\noriginal expectations, with upside coming mainly from Baidu Core. Looking into\nthe fourth quarter, we expect Baidu Core revenues to grow on a year-over-year\nbasis.\n\nOn the cost side, our disciplined approach to managing resources and focusing\non investment returns coupled with the strengthening of Baidu's mobile\necosystem allowed us to deliver significant margin improvement sequentially.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin for Baidu Core reached 36% in the third quarter, up\n1,200 basis points sequentially.\n\nAs of October 31, 2019, we have returned approximately USD 1.2 billion to our\nshareholders, USD 778 million under the 2018 Share Repurchase Program, which\nexpired in June this year, and USD 397 million under the 2019 Share Repurchase\nProgram.\n\nOperator, with that, let's open the call to questions.\n"", ""Yes, the question with regards to our cost structure, I think when you look\ninto Q4, I think we said 2 things. We said that from Q2 to Q3 sequentially,\nwe're able to increase our non-GAAP operating margin and net margin for 2\nreasons. One is the operational efficiency, and Robin talked about that. With\nthe stronger mobile ecosystem, users are stickier, they're coming more for\nbetter technology searches and so forth. So that's helping us. And the second\nfactor is our cost management initiatives that we've implemented. Obviously,\nthese types of factors would be able to carry through going forward.\n\nSo when we look at for example Q4, I expect we would have a similar impact as\nwe did at Q3, meaning that margin should be similar to Q3. We continue to look\nat other areas where we can implement cost management initiatives, and we'll\nalso continue to focus on operational efficiency.\n"", ""Eddie. Yes, in our prepared remarks we talked about the industries that we\nthink we are doing well. I mentioned that education, retail, e-commerce and\nservice sectors did well, which are the areas that we've historically done\nwell. I think the fact is that we're now enabling closed-loop transactions in\nBaidu App, we're able to allow people who come on our platform to do marketing\nservices with the closed-loop experience, so that you can see continued\nimprovement in conversion, and it helps with our revenue growth and the\noverall effectiveness of marketing. So those are kind of the trends that we're\nseeing.\n\nIn regards to the first quarter. I think first quarter historically has been\nthe lowest quarter seasonality for us if you look at the last few years. So we\nexpect from Q4 into Q1 is a down quarter because of seasonality. Q4, we're\ngoing to have a strong strength probably from e-commerce, retail and so forth,\nthe Double 11 celebration and so forth. And then in the first quarter, we're\ngoing to have a Chinese New Year. And so that kind of change, we're going to\nexpect down. Historically, it's down in the teens from Q4 to Q1, and we'll\nhave better view of this as we progress and get closer to Q1.\n"", ""So far, we haven't finished planning for Q1. We've actually just started our\nplanning for 2020. So right now, we don't see particularly major branding\ncampaign plans. Although historically, as you saw last year, there was such\ncampaigns with CCTV and so forth. I think that we'll probably know better in a\nmonth or so once we are midway into our 2020 planning. But I think that,\ntypically, we're very strong with mobile, and during Chinese New Year, that's\nwhere mobile traffic is stronger relatively to PC. And that's really an\nopportunity for us to show the world the things like the great products that\nwe have in our MEG (Mobile Ecosystem Group) and our SLG (Smart Living Group)\nand so forth. So that's something we'll be considering, but we'll have\nprobably more information in a month or so.\n"", ""Okay. And let me talk a little bit more about our revenue makeup. With regards\nto verticals that you talked about, auto and financial services, those are\nboth down, right? Automobile, as we know, the number of car unit sales this\nyear is down. If you look at the industry, it's not doing as healthy. If you\nlook at financial services, that's another area that has been down since Q1\nthis year, and this has been down pretty significantly.\n\nOn travel, we've been focusing on building better products. We have good\ncontent. We have a strategic relationship with Trip.com and so forth. And so\ntravel overall has done well. It's one of our stronger verticals.\n\nWith regards to health care. If you look at health care, we started\nintroducing Managed Page last December. And at the end of March this year, we\nrequired that everyone who's doing advertising in mobile on Baidu to switch\nover their H5 sites to our Managed Page. And that has put a damper in terms of\nrevenue on those who would probably have put quality content. Customers just\nwill not come to Baidu. And then because we now have stronger control of the\ncontent that on there and so forth, we are putting emphasis on ensuring that\nthe content on our pages are good for our users. And we started then rolling\nout on to PC in July, which is less than 20% of total health care revenues. So\nin Q3, really, it's a partial quarter hit. Q4, you'll see a full quarter hit.\nSo we actually have seen most customers who are switching over have switched\nover. So we don't see too much of a difference from Q3 into Q4.We're halfway\nthrough the quarter. So as of right now, we don't see too much difference from\nQ3 to Q4.\n\nBut if you look at it overall, our revenue guidance for Baidu Core in the last\nfew quarters, we had more uncertainties, and we started with a range of\nnegative percentage. And this quarter, now we're guiding from 0% to 6%. So we\nthink that in terms of year-over-year growth, we're much better off in the\nlast couple of quarters. I think in May, we said that we'd come back with a\n100-day plan. We executed very well from both top line and bottom line. And so\nyou see our business getting more solid and that the products that we talked\nabout, the hosted marketing platforms with the strengthening mobile ecosystem,\nso that's helping us, I think, fight the current softer macroeconomic\nenvironment.\n"", ""Greg, yes, so with regards to the 2 expense items, we talked about TAC. TAC\nstill grew 5% year-over-year. I think TAC's growth rate has levelled off. It's\ngrowing slower year-over-year than our previous quarter. I think a couple of\nthings. Number one is as we focus more on building our mobile ecosystem, we're\ngoing to be relying more on in-app searches to grow our revenue. And we've\nbeen transitioning off this, I think, over the last year. I think The Street\nmisinterpreted our strategy to move over into in-app services because in-app\nservices we are required to pay for channel costs upfront and then you would\nhave revenues over the following quarters. When we look at the user lifetime\nwith TAC, every dollar you spend get that revenue in that same quarter. So as\nour business model shifted, margin shifted, and The Street took, I think,\nseveral quarters to understand that. So I think that's one issue. And I think\noverall so far, I think we are having still increasing other costs. I think\nTAC price is still increasing, but I think it's not hitting us as bad on\nmargin as the previous quarters.\n\nWith sales and marketing, as Robin mentioned, we were still spending heavily\non sales and marketing. But on a year-over-year basis, we're down for sales\nand marketing plus G&A. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks how much\nwe spent for channel and promotional marketing is a function of investment\nreturn. Although we don't expect every dollar we spend to get a return in the\nsame quarter, we would measure over the lifetime value of the users. So as the\neconomy softens and we're seeing the returns are not meeting the internal\nthreshold that we had set, then we'll tone it back. You can see, for example,\nBaidu App is actually quite profitable because it's a good segment of our\noverall business.\n\nSo I think with the economy like this, we'll be more careful in terms of\nspending. We're looking for a return that we can get. But as the economy gets\nbetter and we're seeing good returns, we might increase that in the future.\nBut ultimately, we think that whatever we spend, we get the return back\nbecause we have a very sophisticated system internally to measure these kind\nof returns to the channel for promotional marketing.\n""]",Herman Yu,CFO
3,"['Gregory, this is Dou. For the search volume, actually, the total mobile search\nvolume, we still see a very good lift year-over-year. And specifically, for\nthe in-app search, as Robin mentioned in the prepared remarks, actually, we\nsaw a 25% year-over-year lift. So given the better experience in Baidu App\nsearch with Baijiahao, smart mini programs and Managed Pages all together, the\nexperience is getting better, measured by all the metrics we are using. Given\nthat, we are going to see the momentum continue in terms of the in-app search\ntraffic in total.\n', ""Okay. For the video question, actually, it's right. There has been an\nexplosive growth in China's short video sectors in recent years. But we\nbelieve that it's far from being over yet. Actually, for us, we distributed\nshort videos not only through our video apps but also through the Baidu App.\nSo actually, in Robin's prepared remarks, he already mentioned that for the\nshort videos, the distribution through Baidu App and video apps, so we see the\ntime spent up to like 35% year-over-year, actually. So not only for the videos\nitself, like even in search, we see that search satisfied through videos\nincreased almost 50% year-over-year. So put that together, we see video is\nactually playing a very important role in Baidu's whole ecosystem. especially\nwith the 5G and over the years, so we're going to see more applications of\nvideos in Baidu's ecosystem.\n"", ""For the marketing customers, what they really care about is the effective\ntraffic. So with the Managed Pages, smart mini programs, actually, we see more\nand more examples where the customers, when they use these services, their ROI\nare being improved. So it's really hard to say how we are going to turn that\ninto numbers, but we do see the trend is going up. And actually, as Robin\nmentioned in the opening remarks, more and more marketing customers are\nadopting our Managed Pages, actually. So we are seeing improvement over ROI.\nThat is going to turn into revenue lift, but it's hard to say the specific\nnumber.\n""]",Dou Shen,SVP

5,"[""Robin and Herman, just looking at the revenue line, could you take us through\nhow you get a 25% traffic growth versus the revenue growth rate that you've\nseen both on a year-on-year basis as well as on a sequential basis?

That's my first question.\n\nAnd second, looking at how well you've managed costs, it's been a very, very\nstrong show. Over the last 2 quarters, your TAC is down from 18.2% to 15.4% of\ncore revenue. Bandwidth cost down to 6.8% from 8.7%. SG&A has calmed down very\nnicely.

One thing that has been a bit volatile in the past is the\nsales and marketing costs in the first quarter depending on any major branding\ncampaign.

So we want to maybe ask you to comment on if you see\nany major challenges for Baidu because we feel so many opportunities at Baidu.\nSo what are the major challenges do you see for Baidu these days?\n\nAnd the second question is, Herman, you commented a little bit about the\ndifferent verticals' performance right now. Can you expand it a little bit\nmore to include verticals like auto, finance, real estate, travel, those\nverticals, so we can have a clear idea about the vertical performance?\nEspecially, can we say the health care and brand advertising segments have\nbottomed?

The demand side, can you\nelaborate more about your observations about macro and ad budget for the next\nyear?

0,"[""Thanks, Robin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Baidu's second quarter 2019 call.\nAll monetary amounts that we'll be discussing or used are in CNY unless stated\notherwise.\n\nLet's now turn to Baidu's second quarter 2019 financial highlights. Total\nrevenues reached CNY 26.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year, excluding spin-off\nrevenues, and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue from Baidu Core was CNY 19.5\nbillion, up 3% year-over-year, excluding spin-off revenues, and up 12%\nquarter-over-quarter.\n\nLet me give you more color on Baidu Core revenues. Baidu's marketing services\nrevenue is well diversified, with the top 12 industry sectors making up about\n2/3 of Baidu Core revenues. Half of the top 12 sectors saw year-over-year\nsales declines, including health care, online gaming, financial services and\nauto logistics. Excluding these poor performing sectors, Baidu Core revenues\nwould have grown in the mid-teens year-over-year in the second quarter.\nAlthough the increase in ad inventory in the market has impacted the overall\ngrowth rate of our marketing services, it's fair to say that a bigger part of\nour revenue slowdown can be attributed to industry-specific policies, self-\ndirected health care initiatives and the softening of macroeconomic\nconditions. Additionally, revenue derived from Baidu's union partners\ncontributed to a 3% drag on Baidu Core's year-over-year revenue growth, which\nis in sync with our goal to optimize profit on past revenues versus bidding\nfor incremental revenue at negative margins.\n\nTotal marketing services customers in the second quarter was approximately\n330,000, down 4% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Please note\nthat this customer number excludes Nuomi customers and other calculation\npolicy adjustments that we have made internally such as excluding customers\nwith minimal daily spending.\n\nOur new AI businesses continue to see fast growth, particularly Baidu Cloud,\nwhich generated CNY 1.6 billion revenues in Q2, up 92% year-over-year.\n\niQIYI revenue reached CNY 7.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year; membership\nrevenue continue to see strong growth, up 38% year-over-year; while iQIYI's ad\nbusiness was down 16% year-over-year, mainly due to slowing macro, delay of\ntop content launches and slower-than-expected recovery of feed advertising.\n\nTurning to cost of sales. Excluding stock compensation and intangible asset\namortization, cost of sales was CNY 15.9 billion, up 33% year-over-year.\nContent, bandwidth and other costs of revenues increased to support Baidu's\ntraffic growth, greater video consumption and new AI businesses, including\nbandwidth and depreciation expenses for Baidu Cloud and cost of goods sold\nrelated to Xiaodu Smart Speakers. TAC increased 27% year-over-year as a result\nof higher TAC revenue share and expansion into offline connected screens and\nother areas.\n\nSG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 4.7 billion, up 13%\nyear-over-year, primarily due to the increase in channel and promotional\nmarketing, mainly for Baidu's family of apps. On a sequential basis, SG&A\nexpenses were down 14% as we scaled back on marketing spending that did not\nmeet our stringent ROI criteria. This has hampered the sequential growth of\nour apps, including Haokan short video and Quanmin flash video. We plan to\ncontinue to manage our marketing dollars with a strong, disciplined ROI\napproach.\n\nR&D expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 3.7 billion, up 13% year-\nover-year, primarily due to increased personnel-related expenses, and up 5% on\na sequential basis.\n\nNon-GAAP operating income was CNY 2 billion and non-GAAP operating margin was\n7% compared to 2% last quarter. Non-GAAP operating income for Baidu Core was\nCNY 3.5 billion or USD 508 million, down 55% year-over-year and up 65%\nquarter-over-quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, total expenditure for Baidu Core\nwere approximately CNY 700 million increase sequentially, less than the CNY 1\nbillion that we had planned at the beginning of the year.\n\nSince our last earnings call, we have been reviewing our businesses for\noperational efficiency and have made significant progress in implementing\nspending discipline, while making investments in future revenue growth and our\n3-year plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Baidu Core was 18% in the second\nquarter compared to 12% last quarter. We expect Baidu Core's incremental\nrevenue growth to have higher margins and non-GAAP operating margin to rise\nabove 20% in the third quarter. As an Internet platform, a big part of Baidu\nCore's cost structure is fixed such as the approximately 2,000 scientists and\nengineers of Baidu's AI lab and our large server network and other\ninfrastructure equipment. Thus, sequential growth of our revenues will likely\nbring about higher margins.\n\nTotal other income was CNY 1.2 billion, which included equity method income of\nCNY 429 million compared to equity method losses of CNY 860 million last\nquarter.\n\nIncome tax expense was CNY 416 million and effective tax rate was 28% compared\nto 18% in Q2 last year, primarily due to the lower pretax income generated\nfrom Baidu Core and to iQIYI not being able to recognize tax benefit from its\nlosses in the current period.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu was CNY 3.6 billion and non-GAAP net\nmargin was 14%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu Core was CNY 4.7\nbillion or USD 690 million, down 46% year-over-year and up 160% quarter-over-\nquarter. Non-GAAP net margin for Baidu Core was 24% compared to 10% last\nquarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was CNY 3.4 billion or USD 489 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin\nwas 13%. Adjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core was CNY 4.8 billion or USD 694\nmillion. Adjusted EBITDA margin for Baidu Core reached 24% in the second\nquarter compared to 19% last quarter.\n\nAs of June 30, 2019, cash and short-term investments was CNY 137.3 billion or\nUSD 20 billion. Excluding iQIYI, cash and short-term investments for Baidu\nCore was CNY 120.9 billion or USD 17.6 billion.\n\nFree cash flow was CNY 5.6 billion and free cash flow for Baidu Core was CNY\n4.9 billion or USD 710 million. Total employees of Baidu Core was\napproximately 29,900.\n\nTurning to third quarter guidance. We expect total revenues to be between CNY\n26.9 billion and CNY 28.5 billion, representing a decrease of 5% to an\nincrease of 1% year-over-year, or a decrease of 1% to 5% increase year-over-\nyear, excluding spin-off revenues of CNY 1 billion for the third quarter of\n2019. In this it also means it’s an increase of 2% to 8% on a quarter-over-\nquarter basis. Excluding spin-off revenues, our guidance assumes Baidu Core\nwill grow between negative 3% to positive 3% year-over-year and between 2% to\n9% quarter-over-quarter. These forecasts are our current and preliminary view\nand are subject to change.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, let me summarize Baidu's second\nquarter. We have made solid progress with our search and feed business.\nTraffic growth remains robust for Baidu App DAUs, with double-digit growth in\nin-app searches and continuous robust growth on feed time spent. User\nexperience is significantly upgraded with content and service providers\noffering native app-like experience on Baidu's mobile platform. Our emphasis\non improving search and feed monetization is in progress. We witnessed double-\ndigit sequential revenue growth in the second quarter and expect further\nsequential growth into the third quarter. Our focus to diversify away from TAC\ntraffic and grow search revenues through in-app search and feed is proving to\nbe a dominant search model as in-app services allow us to gain more user\ninsight across vast domain of knowledge, content and services, and\ncontinuously improve on user engagement for both Baidu and our marketing\nservices customers. We are making meaningful strides in the area of voice\nassistant, cloud and smart transportation, which will be critical revenue\ndrivers as we look out 1 to 3 years. On the content management side, we will\nbe diligent on reining in our expenditures with disciplined ROI\nimplementation, while balancing the needs for near-term and long-term revenue\ngrowth. iQIYI is weathering the challenging macro environment with strong\nmembership growth and the diversification of its revenue stream.\n\nOperator, with that let's now open the call to questions.\n"", ""Thanks, Greg, for the question. As we mentioned on the prepared remarks, our\nSG&A, mainly marketing expenses, are very ROI-driven. So when we are spending\nthe channel costs and other marketing programs, we're looking at the lifetime\nvalue that we can get from our users. So when the economy is good and we think\nthat we can generate more revenues compared to the cost that we have\naccumulated, then we'll spend more money. Because we're transitioning from a\nTAC model to a in-app services model, TAC you get revenue in the quarter that\nwe expense, but in the channel cost and in the marketing program in-app\nservices, which we're expensing in that one quarter, then we might deriving\nrevenue from the user and in the quarters after that, there's a lag. But even\nwith that, we are very disciplined in calculating ROI. So you see us spending\nmore on Q1 when we see higher ROI. With the current macro conditions and some\nof the issues that we talked about in prepared remarks, the ROI has come down.\nAnd as a result, we've been very diligent in screening out the marketing costs\nthat has a low ROI. And we'll be looking at that continuously very closely as\nwe move forward for the remainder of the year.\n\nWith regards to our content costs, I think it's been growing on a year-over-\nyear basis, but recognize that Baidu Core, the content cost is not that\nsignificant. For example, in the second quarter, we talked about maybe CNY 0.5\nbillion per quarter. So although the increase is significant on a percentage\nbasis, but the total cost is 0.5 billion. So we're increasing even if the base\nis pretty very small. I don't think it's that significant compared to our\noverall expenditures.\n"", ""Let me add a point, Alicia. For the Smart Mini Programs, I think from a\nservice provider, there's a couple of points that are key for them. First is\nas the number of smartphones in China sales is declining, we saw that last\nyear, we saw that first half of this year, it cost more and more to actually\nleverage our App Stores in order to have installation of their apps. The\neconomics of Smart Mini Programs is much better than App Stores because app\nstores, you have to spend the channel cost and you're not sure if you're going\nto get ROI, whereas Mini Programs, because we're in the business of search,\nthese are natural results to be in search.\n\nSo rather than shifting this and directing the traffic over to your apps, you\nhave to, first, pay-per-channel app. Secondly, there's usually more steps, for\nexample, to convert a sale from our Mini Programs to -- within an app versus\nif you're a native on Baidu's platform directly to that buy page on the Mini\nProgram. So I think first of all, you're able to see that result right away.\nYou don't need users to download the app. And secondly, I think the case that\nDou have explained would help drive up conversion. So obviously, with better\nconversion, marketing customers are usually focused on better conversion,\nlooking at ROI.\n\nSo with better conversion, you'll have, we believe, over time, more people\ndeveloping Smart Mini Programs so that when they have their search results,\nthey have better conversion. I think from a user perspective, you will\nprobably have users over time relying more and more on search within Baidu\nbecause of that native app experience directly with the Mini Programs.\n"", ""And just to add, Tian, you asked which areas will we be interested in. When\nyou look at our content, Baidu as a whole, there's really 3 categories of\ncontent. We're looking at a content that's knowledge-based, in this case,\nZhihu. In case of Baidu Knows, that would be it. So we're looking at example\nthe vast amount of services and information that are in apps today and making\nthat basically having a native app experience. So service is very important.\nAnd clearly, we're looking at industry verticals where right now, if it's\nfragmented on the Internet, if we can concentrate it within Baidu's content\nplatform so that they have better conversions so that they can build user\nengagement and have better user experiences. So 3 areas: knowledge, services\nand industries vertical information.\n"", 'Yes. And Eddie, with regards to our top industry, we have health care as you\nguys know is our top. In addition to that, the other industries are much\nsmaller. So the top 12 industries are 2/3 , and the remaining industries are\nall less than 10% of Baidu Core’s revenue, and those would include e-commerce,\nonline games and education.\n', ""And James, the question you asked about revenue and expenses. We typically do\nnot give guidance out of 2 quarters. And with the current macro situation,\nit's hard to predict what's going to happen in 2 quarters. But I would use a\nreference. For example, if you look at last year, Q3 to Q4 has very minimal\nsequential growth. So if the economy keeps pace and so forth, we will probably\nhave similar trends. But I can't commit at this point given that we don't have\nas much visibility in the current macro situation.\n\nAnd so when we set our expenditures for the second half, we're cognizant of\nthe current of revenue situation and the economic conditions. So from an\nexpenditure perspective, in terms of total expenditure for Baidu Core, cost of\nsales plus operating expenses, we're going to try to keep pace with our total\nexpenditures for Q2. So we should not see too significant increase from the\nsecond quarter level. And mind you that this would adjust if, for example, our\nrevenue, for example, improves significantly and so forth. So that's current\nthinking right now.\n"", ""Natalie, on the financial impact of CRM, we are currently trying to do an\nintegrated solution for our online marketing customers. They already spent a\nlot of money to try to acquire potential customers for their products and\nservices, and we help them to better manage this process and achieve better\nconversion. We think, longer term, the CRM offering will be able to provide\nindependent product value, and we will be able to charge a significant amount\nof money for this kind of offering. But to begin with, we'd like to help our\nadvertisers and customers to think in a more holistic way. They acquire\ntraffic from the Baidu channel, and we help them to better manage the traffic\nor better manage the users, and then help them to improve the overall\nefficiency of the whole marketing funnel. That's the difference between our\nCRM and the independent CRM products.\n"", ""Yes. So when you look at the number of customers from the health care sector,\nwe saw them started to drop off at the beginning of the year, and we've seen\nthat consistently into Q2. And as Robin mentioned earlier, because once they\nuse the managed pages, we're able to screen the content using our AI. We're\ninstalling, for example, live call capabilities and messaging capabilities. So\nwe use our AI to also screen the communication with users to make sure that\nthey're providing content and information that was more secure and more\ntrustworthy. So as a result of that, it's a filtering system for the lower-\nquality health care providers. So those are probably going to go elsewhere,\nprobably going to drive revenues for other people. For us, we're basically\nturning away the lower-quality customers in health care.\n"", ""Okay. With regard to the questions on the numbers, a few verticals that helped\nus grow sequentially are retail and e-commerce or education. Travel did very\nwell, too, and then service-related industries. So these are some of the\nhighlights for the second quarter. And then with regards to health care\nrevenues, we're seeing double-digit declines in health care revenues (year\nover year). So when you look at the second quarter, as a percentage of total\nBaidu Core revenues, we're talking about less than 1/7 of our revenue. So that\nhas declined pretty significantly when you look at it from last year. But I\nthink for the long term, it's better for us because we're now having a better\nway to ensure better quality of the content, both looking at the landing page\nand also monitoring the kind of communication between the merchants with the\nusers.\n""]",Herman Yu,CFO
1,"[""Okay. Thanks for your question, actually. As you say, the Mini Program has\nattracted much attention from the developers. We have seen the benefit of the\nSmart Mini Programs already, but for the users, the better Smart Mini Programs\noffer them richer content in service selection. And then for developers, the\nSmart Mini Programs use our AI-powered algorithms to screen the massive\ncontent of the Smart Mini Programs and recommend the relevant content and\nservice to the users based on their proactive search for information and\nservice.\n\nSo this Smart Mini Program already helped the developers to acquire users, and\nin turn, to enhance better user experience on the Baidu's platform. So\nactually, as you may already have seen, Baidu Smart Mini Program has attracted\nsome well-known apps like Weibo, Meituan, JD as well as services with lower\nfrequency of usage like the Shanghai Auto Show.\n\nSo that' said, we also have our customers from different industry sectors.\nThey have tried the Smart Mini Programs as their landing page for their\ncampaigns. So we see pretty significant ROI lift for those who tried this\nSmart Mini Programs. So actually, the Smart Mini Programs also offered our\ncustomers and the developers much more options to engage the users in their\nservice. So with that, the ROI would be further improved. So that is how we're\ngoing to see how Mini Programs is going to help first to strengthen our\nmonetization capabilities, actually.\n\nAs to CRM, actually it's just a start. And because we guided that most of our\ncustomers, they have the leads generated from Baidu's platform, so combined\nwith the CRM, we have more ways to help the customers to engage with their\nusers better and to explore the leads in a better way to improve the\neffectiveness and also clearly to improve the ROI. So that's why we are using\nthe CRM to help the campaigns on our platforms first, and then in the next\nlevel, we're going to provide more valuable features to the customers to\nfurther explore the utilities of the CRM.\n"", ""This is Dou, actually. Let me answer your question first. For sure, content is\nextremely important to our whole business, as we've already shown you in the\npast. So for Baijiahao, we see the creators on Baijiahao grow significantly\nover year-over-year, reaching like 2.2 million creators already. So that is\nstill not enough for us because users come to Baidu for not only information\nbut also services. That's why we just discussed how we are strengthening the\nSmart Mini Programs to provide further information and service, which we see\nsignificant growth as well.\n\nIn addition to both Baijiahao and Smart Mini Programs, we're also working with\neven wider collaborators to provide valuable information. As we have noted, so\nwe invested in Zhihu. We've got Zhihu providing additional information,\ncomplementary information to Baidu's Zhidao (Baidu Knows). And we see our\nusers' interest out of the search queries, they have strong interest in\nZhihu's content. So that's why we invested in those. So along with that, we\nare trying to look for more and more content which can better satisfy our\nusers' interest.\n\nSo in short, to sum up, so we will keep looking for better content. And as we\nknow, the content is extremely important for the whole business today. So we\nare developing our own platforms to generate content. We are looking for\npartners to get more useful information and service as well.\n"", ""Okay. I will just add one more thing on that. So as Robin just mentioned, we\nare looking for better user experience. Actually, when we switched Baidu Knows\nto the Smart Mini Program in our platform, we see significant user spend time\ngrowth, actually. So for Zhihu, now is most of the content are presented in\nthe form of H5. With this deal, we're going to convert all of the Zhihu\ncontent in Baidu's platform to Smart Mini Programs, and this will be another\ngood example to show how we are going to improve the user experience through\nthe Smart Mini Programs, actually.\n"", ""Okay. For the new players in the market, I think it's not new, actually. So\nsearch business is a pretty profitable business, as we all know. So we have\nplayers who are trying to enter into this business in the past decades. So\nactually, search has a very high entry barrier actually because user come to a\nsearch engine with a very specific information need. We need to locate that\ninformation out of hundreds billions of web pages to get an information\nlocated.\n\nSo this is quite different from other business like feed because for feed, we\nusually just show general interest and then the engines to match the user's\ngeneral interest. So it's not easy to tell right or wrong. But for search,\nit's the user usually has a very strict demand and strict criteria to judge\nthe performance. So that said, we see for us, I know we have actually the only\none successful twin engine model with both search and feed so far in the\nworld. So in our experience, we see it is relatively easy to switch from\nsearch to feed because we can generalize the users' interest of their queries\nbut not the other way.\n\nSo we're not surprised to see new players in this market, and we have seen\nthis many times. So that said, we are happy to see new players. But with the\nBaijiahao and Smart Mini Programs, we are strengthening our mobile ecosystem,\nand we see we're providing better user experience to the users, so that’s\npretty much what I can offer at this time.\n"", ""For the Smart Mini Programs, let me add a few new things. So actually the user\ncome to Baidu not only for information but also for service. So with Smart\nMini Programs, we provide both information and service to the users. So that's\nsaying we are seeing growth for Smart Mini Programs in quite a few different\nverticals, including travel, real estate, education and other stuff. So say\nfor Weibo and Xiaohongshu, right, so in general, we think they provide\ninformation to users. And for this type of Smart Mini Programs, we see each of\nthem has like a few million users, daily active users actually in Baidu's\nplatform for their Smart Mini Programs. Also, the Smart Mini Program is very\nvaluable to developers with long tail information and service, because users\ncome to Baidu yearly looking for some long tail information and service. So\nthis is very helpful for them to locate new users, because new users come here\nproactively to identify or locate some information. So for those type of\nbusiness, they also get players for the Smart Mini Programs. So for your\nquestion about marketing customers, we do see more and more customers adopting\nSmart Mini Programs as their landing page. So we see examples from travel like\nCtrip, from real estate, from education like Xueersi.? So all those customers,\nwe do see their performance, budget performance are getting better through\ndifferent traffic. So these are just some examples to see, and we are\nexpanding the coverage of the landing pages through Smart Mini Programs. So\ndown the road, maybe you can see more good examples, to share more information\nwith you.\n"", ""Okay. Thanks for the question. So actually, as we mentioned in the remarks,\nright, so Smart Mini Programs and managed pages are 2 forms we are using for\nthe landing pages. So for the marketing customers, they do not have to\nspecifically use Smart Mini Programs, but they can use it in a lighter\nversion, managed pages. For the health care vertical industry, so as Robin has\nalready mentioned, all the marketing customers, they have switched from HTML5\nto managed pages. So in this way, we cannot only guarantee the quality of the\ncontent and the information correctness for the landing page. We can also help\nthe marketing customers to engage in a better way with their users.\n\nSo you can treat Smart Mini Programs as another way or a relatively heavier\nway with even stronger capabilities to strengthen the engagement. So that's\nwhy for all the services which you need relatively complicated interactions to\nfulfill users' need, right, so those for type of business, Smart Mini Programs\nare a better way to do this.\n\nDown the road, to guarantee the quality of the landing page, so the\ncorrectness of the information, we will strongly recommend the marketing\ncustomers to use either managed pages or Smart Mini Program. But in the\nmeanwhile, since we see most of the cases, if not all, are using Smart Mini\nPrograms or managed pages, the customers already see the lift in their ROI. So\nwe bet, they are going to switch even by themselves. I think that's what I can\noffer now. Is that okay?\n"", 'Yes. In terms of sector in relation to health care, we also mentioned moving\ncompanies, home repair, attorneys. They are all using managed pages with this.\n', ""Sure. Actually, I think we have touched this question previously. The user\nacquisition efficiency is getting higher and higher, actually. So as Herman\njust mentioned, we are spending the marketing budget in a smart way to\nconsider more about the ROI. That's why nowadays, when we look at the new\nusers we acquired, their lifetime spend on Baidu is growing pretty\nsignificantly, actually. Because of the content quality and also the service\nprovided by Smart Mini Programs, we can see even stickier engagement between\nthe users and our service.\n\nAnd all that together, that's why we can explain the traffic is growing\nrelatively significant. But for sure, summer is also a good time for traffic\nin general. So that's another reason we see the growth. But in general, with\nthe better content, as we just mentioned, from Baijiahao, Smart Mini Programs\nand also the strong collaboration with partners to provide better content and\nservice, we can see the engagement between users and platforms is being\nstrengthened.\n""]",Dou Shen,SVP

3,"[""Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today.\n\nBaidu's second quarter revenues reached CNY 26.3 billion, above our guidance\nmidpoint of CNY 25.8 billion, which can be attributed to Baidu Core performing\nbetter than our original expectation. Baidu's Q2 revenues grew 9% sequentially\nand Baidu Core revenues grew 12% quarter-over-quarter in spite of the impact\nfrom industry-specific policies, self-directed health care initiatives and\nslowing macro environment.\n\nIn the midst of significant influx of ad inventory into the market, we are\nseeing an upward trend for Baidu's revenue on a sequential basis. Our\nmonetization foundation is strengthening the strong traffic growth such as\nBaidu App DAU, in-app search queries and feed time spent and strong growth of\ncontent and services on Baidu's platform. As our mobile ecosystem expands, we\nare able to better understand user behavior as users navigating the landing\npages on Baidu's platform. Over time, this deepening user insight will allow\nus to further improve Baidu's user experience and ad conversion for our\nmarketing customers.\n\nOn today's call, I will share recent developments on our search and feed\nbusiness and highlight the progress that we have made on our AI business. In\nearly July, we held our annual AI developer conference, Baidu Create, in\nBeijing, which drew approximately 7,000 developers and partners from around\nthe world and was concurrently broadcasted from the Internet. We released the\nBaidu Brain version 5.0, which includes industrial applications of Baidu AI\ntechnologies. Baidu Brain is the common AI engine that powers all of our\nbusinesses, from search and feed to DuerOS, Apollo, Cloud and iQIYI.\nDevelopers can access the AI capabilities of Baidu Brain through Baidu AI Open\nPlatform, which saw developer accounts reaching 1.3 million in June, up 37% in\nthe first half of this year. Enabling a large developer community is important\nin the world of AI computing as our Baidu Cloud ecosystem and capabilities. At\nBaidu Create, we also expanded our strategic alliance with top industry\nplayers, including Geely Auto, Huawei and Intel.\n\nLet's begin our operational review with MEG, our Mobile Ecosystem Group. In\nJune, average DAUs on Baidu App continued to see robust growth, reaching 188\nmillion, up 27% year-over-year, contributed by the synergy generated when\nsearch is combined with feed. Search and feed provide Baidu 2 strong traffic\nengines. Baidu's Search is an indispensable means by which people find more\nobjective and reliable information, and our feed is powered by Baidu's AI\nalgorithms formulated with Baidu's unmatched intent-driven user insight.\n\nOur relentless focus to strengthen Baidu's mobile ecosystem, by enabling\nnewsfeed and short videos searchable through Baijiahao accounts, and\ninformation and services found in third-party apps searchable through Baidu\nSmart Mini Program, is driving more usage scenarios for Baidu App. In June,\nuser time spent on feed grew 33% year-over-year and in-app search queries grew\nover 20% year-over-year. In addition to Baidu App, total time spent on our\nfeed and short video apps together grew robustly, up 67% year-over-year in\nJune.\n\nBaidu is the premier go-to destination in China to find knowledge-based\ncontent and longtail information. To supplement information on third-party\nsites, we have spent years developing an extensive knowledge-based content\necosystem such as Baidu Encyclopedia, Baidu PostBar and Baidu Knows to make\nuseful, sought-after knowledge readily accessible.\n\nAs we focus on strengthening Baidu's mobile ecosystem, Chinese users are\nbecoming more dependent on Baidu for knowledge content. For example, in June,\ndaily time spent per user on Baidu Knows in Baidu App grew 55% sequentially,\ndaily video views of Baidu Encyclopedia grew 80% year-over-year and membership\nand services revenue for Baidu Wenku grew 61% year-over-year. Baidu's mobile\necosystem is drawing newsfeed and short video content creators to Baijiahao\naccounts, which saw publisher accounts reaching 2.2 million in June, up 83%\nyear-over-year.\n\nApp developers are also making their services and information available\nthrough Baidu Smart Mini Program, which saw MAUs accelerate to 217 million in\nJune, up 49% sequentially, and the number of Smart Mini Programs increased\nmore than sixfold in the last 3 months.\n\nBaidu Smart Mini Program offers our users richer content and services\nselection and provides traffic to app developers without requiring users to\ndownload their apps. This native app-like model improves user experience and\nwill ultimately improve app conversion and expand the monetization potential\nof Baidu's marketing services platform.\n\nBaidu Smart Mini Program is attracting well-known apps such as Weibo, Meituan\nand JD as well as services with lower frequency usage. On the latter, for\nexample, the Shanghai Auto Show is held every 2 years in China. This past\nApril, the event host created a mini program on Baidu and WeChat and leveraged\nother online sites to promote their events. In 1 month's time, the Shanghai\nAuto Show attracted 3 million users to its Baidu Smart Mini Program, which\noffered indoor event navigation, ticket purchase and electronic event pass. In\nthe end, Baidu was Shanghai Auto Show's largest third-party channel for ticket\nsales.\n\nWhereas other mini programs allow users to search the titles of mini programs,\nBaidu Smart Mini Program allow our users to search the massive content within\nthose mini programs to locate the most relevant information and services.\nSimilarly, our top 1 capabilities, which recently satisfied 51% of the\nqueries, allow users to search the massive content on the Internet and satisfy\nuser's intent with Baidu's first recommendation. From the developer's point of\nview, Baidu Smart Mini Program helped service providers attract higher quality\nusers with Baidu's intent-focused user base.\n\nConsistent with Baidu's search and feed philosophy, we offer an open ecosystem\nthat embraces and promotes a wide array of Smart Mini Program developers,\nwhich provides more options to our users. For example, long-form video apps\nwho have joined Baidu Smart Mini Program include Youku, iQIYI, PPTV and China\nMobile's MIGU video as well as traditional media such as Guangdong Satellite\nTV.\n\nBaidu managed page is another area that we are strengthening our mobile\ncontent ecosystem and is one of the options by which we are enabling industry-\nspecific merchants to more effectively reach and engage with users. In lieu of\nHTML5 sites, industry-specific merchants can provide their information on\nBaidu managed page, which is open and freely accessible by other traffic\nsources. Since the merchant content resides on Baidu's platform, we are better\nequipped to ensure greater reliability and trustworthiness on the information\noffered by the merchants.\n\nStructured data for health care industry is a form of managed page. In March,\nwe required our health care marketing services customers to switch over from\ntheir H5 page to Baidu managed page for the landing pages of their mobile ads,\nand in July, we expanded the requirement to health care PC ads. Baidu Managed\nPage for the health care industry allows us to monitor the health care\nprovider's information and communication with users, while enabling our\nmanaged page platform to continuously add new functionality, for example, live\nchat and call features with the health care provider, incognito caller ID to\nprotect user information and consumer protection program for added consumer\ncomfort. We are seeing significant improvement in user experience with managed\npage, and search queries on health care are growing faster than before. The\nincrease in traffic, improvement in health care content quality and added\nfunctionality are generating meaningful lifts in customer leads for health\ncare providers on managed page.\n\nWhile our self-directed health care initiative has dragged down our recent\nrevenue growth and optic-wise make it that much more difficult to implement in\nthe current macro environment as the lower-quality health care providers are\ngoing elsewhere, we believe improving user experience, better management of\nhealth care information and lead conversion for our health care customers will\ngenerate greater value for Baidu over time.\n\nAside from health care, we are adopting managed page for home services such as\nmoving companies and home repair. And in July, we began to offer attorneys,\nwhich as a collective body, has fragmented online presence, an easy way to\npromote their businesses in a card format in Baidu's search results. From the\ncard search result, users can access an attorney's educational background,\nlegal credentials and legal cases handled as well as social features such as\nuser commentaries and ratings.\n\nManaged page gives us the opportunity to build industry-specific solutions to\nempower SMEs and allow them to better leverage web traffic and engage with\nusers without having to maintain an IT department and keep pace with Internet\ninfrastructure and technologies. SMEs can simply run a business using Baidu's\nmanaged page, and we will continue to add tools, services and features to\nBaidu's platform over time to improve their user engagement and lead\nconversion. Extending managed page into new industries should further expand\nBaidu's revenue growth opportunity.\n\nLooking forward, we are excited about MEG's market position and monetization\nopportunities, with traffic growing robustly, our mobile content ecosystem\nexpanding and different monetization plans in the works, including the recent\nlaunch of Baidu CRM in July, especially when we step out of the weak macro\nenvironment.\n\nMoving to DuerOS. In the second quarter, DuerOS voice assistant continues to\ngain momentum through the use of Baidu's leading technologies in speech,\nnatural language processing and search. DuerOS installed base surpassed 400\nmillion, up 4.5 fold year-over-year, and monthly voice queries surpassed 3.6\nbillion, up 7.5 fold year-over-year in June.\n\nDuerOS first-party smart devices is experiencing strong sales momentum. Market\nresearch firms Canalys and Strategy Analytics ranked Xiaodu Smart Speaker #1\nin shipment in China for the first quarter, which is quite an incredible\nachievement considering Baidu launched Xiaodu smart devices only last year,\nand compared to our peers who have online distribution and hardware management\nstrategic advantages.\n\nXiaodu Smart Display, with average selling price of approximately USD 50 per\nunit, is becoming a sweet spot for us as it penetrates not only first and\nsecond tier cities, but also lower tier cities in China, becoming an important\ncomputing device for affordable Internet connectivity. Average time spent of a\nSmart Display has reached about 2 hours a day and sales volume of Smart\nSpeaker in China is forecasted to reach over 35 million units this year,\nsimilar to the expected decline in smartphone unit sales in China, making AI-\npowered smart speakers an indispensable Internet channel for content and\nservice providers, especially with mobile internet user and time spent slowing\nin China.\n\nThe rise of smart speakers seems to mirror the rise of smartphones a decade\nago, when smartphones took over feature phones with the advent of iOS and\nAndroid app stores. This shift was spurred by the change in input modality and\nthe superior user experience of mobile apps.\n\nFar-field conversational AI is making it easier for users to interact with\nsmart speakers. Xiaodu stands out from the competition with leading speech\nrecognition and natural language processing capabilities. For example,\nrecently added full-duplex continued conversation feature enables continuous\ndialogue with Xiaodu smart devices without wake words, while Xiaodu\nintelligently distinguishes between the voice queries directed at Xiaodu\nversus dialogues directed at human. In July, we announced the development of\nBaidu Honghu, an energy-efficient AI chipset to power voice interaction in\nhomes and autos, to further improve Xiaodu's conversational AI capabilities\nwhile driving down unit economics.\n\nWe are gradually seeing time spent on skills surpassing time spent on music\nand videos on smart speakers. This is quite exciting, with the number of\nskills in DuerOS skills store doubling sequentially to over 2,400 and DuerOS\ndeveloper community growing to above 33,000. Seven car models were recently\nreleased with DuerOS-powered infotainment and 30 car models are in the\npipeline, scheduled to be released with DuerOS preinstalled.\n\nTurning to Apollo. We are excited that Apollo continues to be the leading\nautonomous driving solution in China with over 155 leading OEM, Tier 1\nsupplier, key component and other partners. In June, Apollo's test fleet of\nover 300 vehicles accumulated more than 2 million test kilometers across 13\ncities. As of July, Baidu has received almost half of the 204 autonomous\ndriving pilot licenses granted in China and Baidu became the only company in\nChina to receive T4 licenses, the highest level of autonomous driving test\nlicense issued by Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport, which permit\nautonomous vehicles to operate in complex driving conditions, including urban\nroads, tunnels, school zones and other scenarios.\n\nAlso in July, First Automotive Works announced commercial production of level\n4 autonomous passenger vehicles to support Apollo-powered robotaxi pilot\nprogram, which is scheduled to be deployed in Changsha, the capital city of\nHunan province, along Baidu's V2X solutions later this year.\n\nTurning to Baidu Cloud. We continue to see momentum of our cloud business with\nrevenues reaching RMB 1.6 billion in second quarter, up 92% year-over-year.\nBaidu Cloud leverages AI capabilities of Baidu Brain to enable enterprises a\nbetter way to do business.\n\nFor example, Baidu Cloud worked with a hardware manufacturer to integrate\nBaidu AI capabilities into their screening solution that helps smartphone\ncomponent OEMs automate the quality assurance process, achieving faster\nthroughput while reducing overhead costs. Baidu AI-powered hardware and\nsoftware integrated solution can take a snapshot of a finished smartphone\ncomponent from 18 angles simultaneously and determine whether the component\nsatisfies the designated QA criteria of the OEM's customer. Unlike human\nscreening, Baidu AI-powered QA screening allows the OEM customer to access the\ndata of screening results for added comfort of quality compliance. We are\nexcited about the opportunities of Baidu's computer vision capabilities to\nhelp Baidu Cloud enterprise customers in sectors like consumer electronics,\nmetal, auto to improve their business.\n\nTurning to iQIYI. iQIYI continues to see solid subscriber growth with\nmembership reaching 100.5 million in June, that's up 50% year-over-year, which\nprovides a strong foundation for iQIYI to offer blockbuster original\nentertainment content. Long-form video content from iQIYI enrich Baidu's\nsearch and feed offerings and improve Baidu's user experience.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Herman to go through our financial\nhighlights.\n"", '', 'Tian, let me just add a few comments. I think our content strategy is pretty\nmuch to adopt the overall user experience to the new mobile ecosystem, meaning\nthat we will make or strike a partnership or investment if that deal can help\nus to improve the user experience. But the content may be available on the\nopen web or on the PC Internet, but if we can have a deal that enhances the\nmobile user experience with that kind of content, we will do it. Or if that\nkind of content is not available on the open web or not available on the PC\nInternet, if we can acquire that content, we will also do it. So basically,\nthe content strategy is to either make the experiences better or make\nsomething that was not available to become available to our Internet users.\n', 'Dou will answer your first question, and Herman will answer the second.\n', ""Yes. On DuerOS, it's a whole new ecosystem. It fully leverages Baidu's\ninvestment in search and in AI technologies for the past many, many years. And\nwe are offering a better and better user experience. It does lower the barrier\nto entry significantly. I talked about it during the prepared remarks that we\nare entering lower cities with more affordable device system. And we are also\nable to access people at very young age or very old age because it's just a\nlot easier to use, and we see strong momentum continue going into the current\nquarter and maybe in the coming years.\n\nTalking about the potential business model, because right now, it's in very\nearly stage, we have not really seriously tried to monetize the product, but\nwe see huge potential in many fronts. For example, in education, it's very\nnatural for kids to learn things through this kind of new devices. Games, can\noffer a very different experience in mobile games because for mobile, you have\nto hold your handset. But for the Smart Display, your hands are free and we\nhave cameras to capture users' behaviors intelligently.\n\nSo there are many, many possible business models, including the app model,\nincluding the subscription model for all kinds of content and services. And\nthis is a whole new era for entertainment, for education and for the smart\nlife for many, many people who may not spend a lot of time with mobile phones.\n"", 'Jin, your question is, are we seeing the number of health care marketing\nservices customers drop off?\n', 'Dou, can you answer the traffic question, the growth rate?\n']",Robin Li,"Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO"

Our Q1 revenue were\nimpacted by industry-specific government policies and our self-directed health\ncare initiative, which required health care marketing customers to move their\nad landing pages onto Baidu's platform.\n\nTowards the end of Q1, we began to see the impact of macro environment,\ncompounded by a significant release of ad inventory into the market, causing\nCPM post Chinese New Year, to not rebound as pronounced as we had historically\nexperienced. Although the Chinese government has announced many economic\npolicies to bolster the economy, given the current macro conditions, tighter\ngovernment scrutiny on content, cut backs from the VC community and so forth,\nwe are taking a cautious view that online marketing in the near term will face\na more challenging environment.\n\nWe are reviewing our resource requirement and improving our execution\ncapabilities, which Herman will discuss in more detail later. While greater\noperational efficiency will be a focus for us, our priority will be to\nstrengthen our mobile business and make the necessary investments to position\nBaidu for higher, long-term growth.\n\nWe are working on a CRM offering for our marketing customers, which we plan to\nrelease later this year that will feature better user targeting, customer\nengagement and sales force management. Coupled with our performance-based\nmarketing services, our Platform-as-a-Service, will allow our marketing\ncustomers to move from user interest and intent targeting to live messaging or\ncall to order taking in a seamless process.\n\nOur CRM app will consolidate Baidu's marketing services placement systems,\nincluding search, feed and Baidu Union, for easier campaign targeting and\nmanagement. Baidu CRM will leverage Baidu's massive user insight, our sales\nforce management experience and technologies and our AI capabilities.\n\nFor example, our smart invitation feature provides personalized prompts to\ninvite users to chat online with sales reps when Baidu AI matches the user\ninterest with relevant customer offering. To better manage its sales force and\nbetter understand their customer calls, our customers can run a report to\nidentify sales agents who were rude on a customer call and summarize comments\nmade by customers during sales calls, leveraging Baidu's advanced Natural\nLanguage Processing capabilities.\n\nIn March, Baidu's mobile reach expanded to 1.1 billion monthly active devices,\nproviding rich intent and interest-based user insights. Our focus on in-app\nservices, expanding our ecosystem of content and services and optimizing user\nrelationship management offer an exciting future for us to grow, to\ncontinuously improve our user experience, stickiness and mind share.\nStrengthening our in-app services and user relationship management are the\nfoundation that allows us to go deeper into the marketing funnel to offer our\ncustomers CRM capabilities beyond our leading performance-based ad.\n\nBeyond the 1.1 billion mobile devices, we hope to expand Baidu's platform\nreach to DuerOS smart devices in homes and in autos and out-of-home digital\nscreens which will enhance Baidu's omni-marketing capabilities.\n\nOur vision for AI-first Internet is to provide the best user experience to our\nusers as they move across Baidu's family of 20-plus apps as well as prepare\nour users to move from mobile-only to a cross-platform experience, seamlessly\ncrisscrossing back and forth on mobile, in homes and in autos. We are quite\nexcited about the opportunities ahead, for example, to offer cross-platform\ndistribution capabilities to Baidu's content providers and service app\ndevelopers.\n\nTo keep pace with the fast-changing technology environment, Baidu has adopted\na young leadership development program to incubate talent for middle\nmanagement and above, to align with the market that we serve and provide an\noption for leaders to retire, pursue their personal interests and release\ntheir responsibilities.\n\nOver the past year, excluding iQIYI, Baidu added 7 Vice Presidents, both newly\npromoted and new hires, to our strong executive team of over 20 members.\nHailong Xiang, our Senior Vice President of Search business, has tendered his\nresignation which I have accepted. I'd like to thank Hailong for his 14 years\nof service at Baidu.\n\nI'd also like to congratulate Dou Shen for his promotion to Senior Vice\nPresident, overseeing Baidu's mobile business, which we have renamed from our\nsearch business. Dou previously served as Vice President of Baidu's mobile\nproducts and has served in various other roles at Baidu since joining in 2012,\nincluding web search, display advertising and financial services group. Prior\nto Baidu, Dou worked at Microsoft and cofounded Buzzlabs. Dou holds a PhD in\ncomputer science from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.\n\nLet's begin our Q1 review with search plus feed. We continue to increase the\nscale and bolster the content and service offering in Baidu App to give our\nusers unmatched native app-like experience for search and feed. Combining feed\nwith search increases user stickiness. We are employing this strategy with\nHaokan and investing in Video Search.\n\nDAU for Baidu App and Haokan are growing robustly. In March, Baidu App DAUs\nreached 174 million, up 28% year-over-year, and Haokan short video DAUs\nreached 22 million, up 768% year-over-year. Total feed time spent on Baidu App\nand short video apps grow robustly, up 83% year-over-year in March.\n\nWe continue to expand Baidu's ecosystem of third-party content and services,\nwhich enable news feed and short videos as well as services and related\ninformation traditionally found only in apps, searchable on Baidu. Baijiahao,\nour feed content network, now hosts 2.1 million publisher accounts, up 89%\nyear-over-year as more and more top publishers, creators and media companies\nare taking advantage of Baidu's large search plus feed distribution scale.\n\nOur Smart Mini Program, including its user base and developer network,\ncontinue to scale. MAUs of Baidu's Smart Mini Program in March reached 181\nmillion, up 23% sequentially. Service providers, large and small, are adopting\nBaidu's Smart Mini Programs as we leverage our search capabilities. For\nexample, Baidu's Smart Mini Program has become the largest traffic channel for\na leading social commerce company in China behind its mobile app. Notably, our\nAI-powered algorithms help male users on the Baidu platform find interesting\ncontent in the social commerce company's Smart Mini Program, increasing a user\ngroup that has been historically underrepresented. Baidu's Smart Mini Program\nallows users to search by the content within the Mini Program, employing our\nstrong search capabilities.\n\nBaidu's Smart Mini Program is also helping users to find less frequented apps\nwith long-tail content. For example, an online urban dictionary adopted\nBaidu's Smart Mini Program and saw its user experience dramatically improve,\nwith daily search traffic increasing by 27x and Baidu's Smart Mini Program\nbecoming its most significant source of traffic.\n\nIn addition, we are strengthening our vertical offerings, such as health care\nand online literature, filtering out poor and questionable content with Baidu\nAI. We are adding mini games in the Baidu App with more vertical offerings to\ncome.\n\nThrough the Chinese New Year Gala campaign, we educated users that Baidu App\nis an all-in-one app, allowing users to search, watch short videos and read\nheadline news, quickly find long-tail information, make direct purchases from\nSmart Mini Program, play mini games and read online literature, just to name a\nfew. Baidu App also offers voice search, augmented reality search and visual\nsearch as well as OCR translation.\n\nOur focus on growing in-app search traffic and expanding our content and\nservices ecosystem is proving to be the right strategy. In addition to growing\nfeed time spend, Baidu App saw search traffic growing in the mid-teens over\nlast year.\n\nTurning to monetization. Our focus to grow in-app traffic build an ecosystem\nfor content, services and vertical offerings, and improve user relationship\nmanagement will provide tremendous potential to improving recommendation\nrelevancy and native app-like experience for our users as well as continuously\nimproving marketing ROI for our customers.\n\nFor example, Jia.com, a home interior-design e-commerce platform, saw leads\nconversion to in-person consultation from Baidu's Smart Mini Program increases\nnearly 30% compared to its HTML5 site. Our focus on in-app traffic and user\nrelationship management will also allow us to provide CRM offering to our\ncustomers which will strengthen our relationships with our customers and open\na large opportunity for future growth. We are also expanding Baidu's online --\nBaidu's advertising partner network to over 1.5 million out-of-home digital\nscreens, covering 362 cities across 31 provinces.\n\nTurning to DuerOS. Our DuerOS voice assistant continues to lead in China with\ninstalled base reaching 275 million, increasing 279% year-over-year and\nmonthly voice queries reaching 2.37 billion, increasing 817% year-over-year in\nMarch. We are expanding the service offering in the DuerOS skills store with\nwide-ranging genre from watching short videos and long videos to playing\nonline games, from listening to children's stories to setting up tools to help\nusers find their phone. App developers are finding that DuerOS skills, or\nvoice-enabled apps, can translate into great user experience and user\nretention. For example, almost 40% of live video Douyu skill's monthly active\nusers on DuerOS continue to use the skill 4 months after initial sign on,\nwhich shows incredible user stickiness.\n\nDuerOS first-party device and the breakout quarter, with first quarter Xiaodu\nseries smart devices surpassing the unit sales of all 2018. OEM manufacturers\nare adopting DuerOS voice assistant as well. For example Skyworth, a leading\nsmart TV manufacturer in China, recently switched the wake word on its TVs to\nXiaodu Xiaodu, and Huawei tablets come with tablet mounts that convert the\ntablet into speech-recognition-enabled DuerOS smart devices.\n\nOn the auto front, Chery Automobile EXEED sedans are selling with DuerOS\ninfotainment system preinstalled. DuerOS for Apollo has received a very\npositive initial customer feedback, particularly for facial recognition\ncapabilities, to activate personalized settings, online payment and AR\nnavigation. On the service front, over 190 Smart Mini Programs from Baidu App\nand skills from DuerOS home devices are now available in the skills store of\nDuerOS for Apollo, including iQIYI, E Designated Driving and GeekPark.\n\nTurning to Apollo. The Beijing Transportation Commission recognized Apollo as\nthe leader in autonomous driving, amassing over 10x the test miles of the next\nindustry player, according to the commission's 2018 Beijing Autonomous Driving\nVehicles Road Test Report issued in March. The report measures safety and\nquality control of autonomous driving and bases its assessment on test miles\nmonitored by the commission as compared to self-reported miles used by other\nautonomous driving reports. The Apollo developer community has now expanded to\n15,000 strong. We are pleased to see that Apollo autopilot technologies have\nbeen adopted in many innovative scenarios, including street cleaning, goods\ndelivery and shuttle services.\n\nTransportation related to vehicles and road infrastructure represent\napproximately 11% of China's GDP, according to the National Bureau of\nStatistics. With the Chinese government open to experimenting the smart\ntransportation to improve urban living, we see an opportunity to partner with\nlocal governments to implement autonomous driving and smart transportation\nsolution across China. We are working with municipalities to pilot robotaxi by\nthe second half of this year. We are also working with Haidian District of\nBeijing to develop an AI-powered city brain to improve municipal services. Our\nentrance into smart transportation is opening doors to the government market\nand potentially expanding into broader smart city solutions to help Chinese\ncities modernize.\n\nTurning to Baidu Cloud. Our cloud business continued to exhibit strong revenue\nmomentum, growing triple digits year-over-year. Last October, we discussed\nimplementing Baidu AI call center solution at one of top telecom operators in\nChina. Baidu Brain is now handling approximately 5.6 million calls per month.\nOur telecom operator customer was pleased with Baidu's AI enterprise solution\nand has signed up to expand Baidu AI call center solutions for half of their\ncall center nationwide. In addition, we are receiving orders from enterprise\ncustomers in other industries, such as financial services, airline and energy.\n\nAt the Baidu Cloud Internet Summit in April, we released a stack of enterprise\nsolutions for companies working with videos. We also released a library of new\ntoolkit that can help developers create, edit, analyze and manage video\ncontent using Baidu AI, including content-adaptive encoding, fully interactive\naugmented reality and a comprehensive video AI model training platform. These\nsolution stacks and toolkit will benefit customers in the video, education,\ngaming and health care industries.\n\nBaidu Cloud is focused on using Baidu AI to solve our customer problems and\nincrease corporate productivity. We differentiate through heavy investment in\nAI and our support for open source deep learning platform.\n\nAccording to the World Intellectual Property Organization 2019 Artificial\nIntelligence Report, Baidu is the leading company globally in patent\napplication for deep learning. Baidu is also the only Chinese Internet company\nlisted among the top 30 AI patent applicants worldwide.\n\nIn March, developer downloads of PaddlePaddle, our leading Chinese open source\ndeep learning platform, was up 40% sequentially. PaddlePaddle helps developers\nto enhance and streamline their deep learning development modules and drive\ngreater adoption of deep learning in real-world applications on Baidu Cloud.\n\nTurning to iQIYI. IQIYI continues to see strong subscriber growth with\nmembership reaching 96.8 million, increasing 58% year-over-year and further\nstrengthening iQIYI's foundation to offer blockbuster original entertainment\ncontent.\n\nA quick word on Baidu's corporate social responsibility. Baidu data centers\nhave obtained more than 400 technology and innovation patents in China and\nabroad. For example, our Yangquan Cloud Computing center, the first double 5A\nenergy-saving data center in China, is widely regarded as an industry role\nmodel with an annual PUE of 1.09, reaching to a top-tier level at global\nstandard, much higher than the average level in China. In 2018, through\ntechnology innovation and clean energy adoption, Yangquan Cloud Computing\ncenter reduced carbon dioxide emission by 177,000 tons. For more information\non Baidu's corporate social responsibility effort, please refer to our newly\npublished CSR report, the website link to which can be found in our earnings\nrelease.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Herman to go through the financial\nhighlights.\n"", ""Alicia, let me answer the first part of your question. Ms. Xiang resigned for\npersonal reasons, and Shen Dou is promoted to Senior Vice President who's in\ncharge of our mobile ecosystem which was formerly named search company. I\nthink Dou is very strong. He has proven track record in managing a lot of\nbusinesses, most recently our feed business has been growing very fast. And if\nyou look at the user front, we have already built a relatively strong mobile\necosystem with a large apps of super apps with very high DAU, the time spent\nis growing, search traffic in the app is growing, and our organic content and\nservices from Baijiahao as well as Smart Mini Programs are all growing. So\ngoing forward, we are confident that, that when we build the stronger sales\nteam and stronger monetization capability, we should be right on track for\nhigher growth.\n"", ""Yes, let me give you a little more color on the growth drivers for search,\nfeed and cloud. Cloud, like I mentioned, was growing by a triple digit, a fast\ngrowth rate. For search and feed, like I mentioned before, the DAU, the time\nspent and page views are all growing in the Baidu app. So we have a relatively\nsolid foundation on the user front. But on the customer front, we need to get\nmore sophisticated, especially when we have all the user information in our\nnative app. We can actually shifting our focus from managing traffic to\nmanaging users and customers. For example, when a customer switched their\nlanding page from HTML5 one to Smart Mini Program, we typically see that the\nconversion improved by 30% to 50%. And the traditional Baidu online marketing\nbusiness is -- you already call it pay for performance. And when the\nperformance improved, let's say, the 30% to 50%, we certainly should be able\nto take a cut from that. And that should just -- the initial result, we\nbelieve that there is still a lot of room to improve. And the reason for that\nis that in the same app, when we have the user information, their mailing\naddress, their demographic information and their telephone number, they don't\nneed to fill out a lot of new forms before they place an order from the Baidu\nApp. This will significantly improve the conversion rate and provide a more\nnative app-like experience for both the users and online customers. And this\nkind of trend, I think we'll be able to last for quite a few years and will\ndrive our growth for the core business.\n"", ""It's going to be a gradual process to see user growth turning into revenue\ngrowth. Like I mentioned, there are a lot of work we can do and we already\nstarted to do this kind of work. We will focus more on managing our users and\nmanaging our customers so that the conversion will continue to improve and so\nthat customers are willing to pay more going forward. And on the outdoor\ndigital screens, those are not really offline screens, those are online\nscreens. We can leverage that as well as our mobile, in-home devices, auto, in\nauto services to do omni-marketing. And when we are able to connect that the\nusers and customers across all different platforms, I believe that, that\ncustomers will be better served.\n"", 'I would say that our user growth continued to be healthy, but we typically do\nnot give up on a daily basis update on the DAU growth.\n', ""And yes, on the headwinds you mentioned macro, new inventory and structure of\nthe data. It's very hard for us to accurately split the percentage amount of\nthese factors, but I think that the general direction is that for the\nstructured data, we have built a good base to improve from. There are a lot of\nlevers we can pull to improve the conversion, improve the user experience.\nWhen those content are structured and hosted on Baidu, we're essentially using\nthe Baidu name to endorse those institutions. So longer term, the conversion\nshould get better and better. For the new inventory, new ad inventory on the\nmarket, we saw a flash of that over the past -- earlier this year, but my\nexpectation is that it's not going to get worse, but it will probably stay the\nsame for the rest of the year. And for macro, there are still a lot of\nuncertainties that we really do not have accurate read.\n"", ""I think when we look at the changes in the marketplace, I think that they're\nout of control like macro, but they are -- so we pretty much focus more on\nthings that we have control of, which is how do we improve the user experience\nand customer experience, and therefore, improve conversion. Like I mentioned\nbefore, by replacing HTML5 sites with Smart Mini Program, we can typically\nimprove the conversion by 30% to 50%. And by hosting the landing page using\nstructured data, we're basically endorsing the customers with the Baidu brand,\nand we're also providing third party more objective comments about those\nadvertising materials as well in the long run improve the conversion. And when\nconversion is improved, the revenue should follow. I think this is more Baidu\nspecific and we have better control of.\n""]",Robin Li,"Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO"
2,"[""Thanks Robin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Baidu's first quarter 2019 call.\nBefore I begin the financial review, let me make a few comments. All monetary\namounts used in my discussion are in renminbi, and all growth rates assume\nyear-over-year growth, unless stated otherwise.\n\nFor the first quarter 2019, total revenues reached CNY 24.1 billion, up 15%,\nor 21%, excluding spinoff revenue of CNY 1.1 billion. At the same time, we\nincurred net loss of CNY 327 million due to our investment in CCTV's Chinese\nNew Year Eve Gala marketing campaign as well as increased loss from iQIYI. Our\nnet margin also decreased with our focus on in-app growth over TAC revenue\ngrowth. In-app growth changes our business model requiring us to spend more\nheavily upfront on marketing, for app installs and user education, while\nmonetization occurs over the lifetime of the users, TAC revenue, on the other\nhand, is earned in the quarter TAC is incurred. Investing in AI and leveraging\nuser insight to improve user relationship management, can offer us greater\ngrowth potential than Union traffic. Revenue from TAC declined in the first\nquarter, as bidding for Union traffic, especially on mobile, continues to be\ncompetitive. Our goal for Union traffic is to maximize profit, unlike some of\nour peers who's bidding on negative margins. The fierce market competition for\nTAC is also weighing down our Q1 margin. The bright side on TAC is that\nBaidu's ad network is expanding into out-of-home digital screens, which\ncomplement Baidu's omni-marketing strategy to reach our users in multiple ways\nand is becoming a source of future revenue growth.\n\nAs Robin mentioned, we are reviewing our business for opportunities to\nincrease operational efficiency. This process will occur over the next few\nmonths, and we will look for opportunity to lessen the currently planned\nincrease of approximately CNY 1 billion in cost structure each quarter for the\nremaining quarters this year. Nevertheless, our priority remains to strengthen\nour mobile foundation, including growing our search plus feed apps, and to\nlead in new AI businesses.\n\nOur Board recently approved USD 1 billion for a stock repurchase. The plan for\nwhich is effective until July 1st next year. This is in addition to the\ncurrent USD 1 billion stock buyback plan in place, approximately USD 500\nmillion of which is available for repurchase until the end of next month.\n\nOverall, we remain optimistic about Baidu's future. In the past 19 years, we\nhave weathered macro conditions, government policy changes and technological\nchanges, each time returning to growth several quarters later. We're excited\nabout our current strategy to make the fastest growing areas of content\nsearchable while adding news feed to our distribution channel; to grow our\necosystem and content services and vertical offerings, enabling us to perform\nuser relationship management and to take advantage of our AI capabilities to\ncapture market opportunities, with voice assistant, cloud and autonomous\ndriving, which may cause us to sacrifice short-term profit but optimize\nsustainable, long-term growth.\n\nLet me now turn to Q1 financial review. Revenue from Baidu Core grew to CNY\n17.5 billion or USD 2.6 billion, up 16%, excluding spinoff revenues, which is\nCNY 0.1 billion lower than the midpoint assumption we had used for our Q1\nguidance. During Q1, we saw revenue stream coming from education,\nretail/e-commerce and services sector, which was partially offset by weakness\nin health care, online gaming, financial services, primarily due to industry-\nspecific government regulations and our self-directed health care initiative.\n\nAt the end of March, the majority of our health care customers have been\nswitched -- have switched their ad landing pages onto our platform. Though our\nstructured data initiatives will dampen near-term revenue growth Q2 -- in Q2,\nwe'll have a full quarter impact. We believe better service quality and user\nexperience will strengthen Baidu's foundation for sustainable long-term\ngrowth. Our structured data initiative is generating healthy traffic growth,\nand we plan to roll out this initiative to other service sectors, such as\nmoving companies, home services and express delivery, to improve the user\nexperience in these areas.\n\nOur new AI services are growing fast, particularly our cloud business, which\ngenerated CNY 1.3 billion in revenues in the first quarter, up 133%. Revenue\nfrom iQIYI reached CNY 7 billion, growing at a robust rate of 43%. Membership\nrevenue continues to be strong with 9.4 million subscribers added in Q1,\ndriven by premium content and hot originals.\n\nTurning to cost of sales. Excluding stock compensation and intangible asset\namortization, cost of sales was CNY 14.6 billion, up 49%. Content cost was up\n47% to CNY 6.2 billion, mainly due to iQIYI's increased investment in content,\nand to a much lesser extent, investment in feed content.\n\nSG&A expenses. Excluding stock compensation, SG&A expenses were CNY 5.5\nbillion, up 94%, primarily due to the increase in channel and promotional\nmarketing, mainly for Baidu family of apps, including marketing campaigns\naround the Chinese New Year Eve as well as increasing personnel-related\nexpenses.\n\nR&D expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 3.5 billion, up 25%,\nprimarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating\nincome was CNY 0.4 billion. Non-GAAP operating income for Baidu Core was CNY\n2.1 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin for Baidu Core was 12%.\n\nIncome tax was CNY 294 million compared to CNY 1.1 billion last year. Lower\nincome taxes mainly due to lower pretax income from Baidu Core.\n\nNon-GAAP net income to Baidu was CNY 967 million, and non-GAAP net margin was\n4%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu Core was CNY 1.8 billion, and\nnon-GAAP net margin for Baidu Core was 10%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was CNY 1.8 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 7%.\nAdjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core was CNY 3.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin\nfor Baidu Core reached 19% in Q1.\n\nAs of March 31, 2019, cash and short-term investments were CNY 143.6 billion\nor USD 21.4 billion. Excluding iQiyi, cash and short-term investments for\nBaidu Core was CNY 125.7 billion or USD 18.7 billion.\n\nOperating cash flow was CNY 1.7 billion. Operating cash flow for Baidu Core\nwas CNY 1.3 billion or USD 191 million. Total headcount of Baidu Core was\napproximately 32,600, down 1% year-over-year.\n\nTurning to second quarter guidance. We expect total revenues to be between CNY\n25.1 billion and CNY 26.6 billion, representing negative 3% to 2% increase\nyear-over-year, or 1% to 6% increase year-over-year, excluding spinoff\nrevenues of CNY 1 billion for Q2. Excluding spinoff revenues, our guidance\nassumes Baidu Core will grow between negative 2% and 4% increase year-over-\nyear. These forecasts are current and preliminary view and are subject to\nchange.\n\nI will now open the call to questions. Thank you.\n"", ""Alicia, this is Herman. Yes, I wanted to just confirm what you noticed. With\nregards to our guidance for Q2, we are assuming that Baidu Core will be\ngrowing approximately negative 2% to positive 4% year-over-year for Q2. And\nyou asked us what were the considerations that we have for Q2, I think several\naspects. As Robin mentioned in his prepared remarks, let me kind of summarize\nthe key factors. I think one is macro factors that we talked about. Number two\nis we started seeing, after Chinese New Year, that there's been an increase in\ninventory, ad inventory release in the market. And as a result, that has been\nimpacting our CPM. So obviously, we're going to be focusing on improving our\nmonetization capabilities going forward. Thirdly, we talked about our health\ncare initiative. I recall in November last year, we said that we're going to\nbe doing this health care initiative for structured data. We are still on\ntrack. We're moving everyone, health care trying to move everyone onto Baidu's\nlanding page. So that was done in March. So you're going to absorb a full\nquarter of that impact in Q2. We think over the long run, since we now\nunderstand the users better, we will understand their behavior as we're\nnavigating on the structure site. We think that, albeit in the long term, we\ncan continue to improve the experience we're seeing in traffic from that\ninitiative actually increasing growth. So I think over time, we're going to be\nable to improve our conversion. And lastly, what we're assuming for the\npolicies that have impacted us, whether it's on gaming, whether it's on\nfinancial services, on real estate, on auto and so forth, will continue to be\nthis way. So if these industry-specific policies improve, that will be upside\nfor us, okay?\n"", ""Eddie, this is Herman. Let me answer that. As we -- as I mentioned in the\nprepared remarks, several industries probably have the slowest growth rate,\nhealth care, online gaming and financial services. I think these 3 will\nprobably be the hardest hit on a year-over-year basis. Beyond that, as we\nmentioned, this is a macro impact. It's impacting our CPMs. So as a result,\nyou're seeing a slowdown growth rate in many industries beyond those 3 that I\nmentioned.\n"", ""Greg, this is Herman. So 2 questions, one on drivers of search, feed and\ncloud. So I'll go first and Robin can add. So I think as we mentioned earlier,\nfor our Q2 guidance, the 4 factors that we're looking at right now that's\nimpacting our growth rate, the macro, our initiative for structured data and\nthe fact that the market is seeing significant increase in supply of\ninventory, and some industry-specific policies, I think those would give you a\ngood indication of the drivers. Obviously, we're going to be focusing\nmonetization. We talked about how we're going to focus on CRM. We're going to\nfocus on other initiatives to increase our CPMs so that we can become more\ncompetitive. I think those are the drivers for advertising. And then we break\nout specifically for cloud that it's CNY 1.3 billion, growing at 133% year-\nover-year. I think the driver for us is to continue to expand into different\nindustries and to replicate a lot of the solutions, enterprise solutions that\nwe have so that it's much faster to grow with existing solutions rather than\nhaving to customize new solutions. So that's kind of our strategy to\naccelerate the growth of our cloud business. And then with regards to cost\nstructures, we originally had planned at the beginning of the year to increase\nour cost of sales and operating expenses by CNY 1 billion per quarter. So the\nincrease incrementally CNY 1 billion quarter-over-quarter for the remaining\nquarters of this year. We have started looking at each of these areas. Our\ngoal is to decrease the increase sequentially through our business reviews.\n"", ""Yes, just to address your plan onto that, [Juan]. The 28% year-over-year is\nwhat we reported for March. So if you're implying that was this impacted by\nthe Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year, as you know, happened in the first\nhalf of February. So whatever that impact, it does have a branding effect that\nallows our users to continue to come back even after Chinese New Year. So I\nthink March is a good indication of the fact that the marketing campaign\nworked and that people remember and that people are willing to come back to\nBaidu App.\n"", ""Piyush, can you repeat that again? What you're implying for 50-some percent?\n"", ""Yes. Good question. I think for our gross margin, the 2 factors you want to\nconsider, number one, is the fact that we're selling smart devices into homes\nDuerOS so hardware sales, as you know, margin is very thin. So as a result,\nthe more hardware sales we're selling. And as we mentioned on the prepared\nremarks that Q1 sales was basically equivalent of all of last year. So while\non the one hand, the sale is doing really well, it's going to impact on\nmargin. And secondly, as I also mentioned in the prepared remarks of our TAC\nrevenues, so you're seeing TAC revenues on the whole declining. At the same\ntime, you're seeing the cost of TAC revenue growing closer to 40% year-over-\nyear in Q1. So these are 2 factors. I would expect going into Q2, with similar\ntrend where you have Q1 TAC revenue was declining. Going into Q2, I don't\nthink the TAC revenue is going to grow too strongly at all. On the other hand,\nI expect smart devices to continue to do well.\n"", ""Yes. And I wanted to add a few more points on structured data initiatives. I\nthink this is an area where I think it's good for Baidu. I think this is\nsomething that, in the short term, is going to impact on margin, but long\nterm, this builds a solid foundation for us to grow. For several reasons\nbecause what you're doing is you're taking over the landing page, right? So\nyou put on Baidu technologies. So in the past, business model is someone\nsearches, we send them to an H5 site and we no longer know what the user does.\nAnd then there could be a lot of false advertising on the landing page. We're\nnow requiring the contents beyond Baidu, and we're using our technology to\nscreen it. So we gained several things. Number one is we get to understand the\nusers more, and at the same time, we request, for example, for these medical\ninstitutions that they have the physicians' bio which will allow us in the\nfuture to do verification. We try to do rating because we now have more\nrelationship with this particular vendor, and we would ask for things like\ncertain business license and so forth. We're able to -- because it's on our\ntechnical platform, we can do screening using our AI. We're adding social\nelements to this so that people can comment on and these rate these vendors\nand so forth. So you can think of how structured it is very similar, for\nexample, the e-commerce where once you have the rating system, you have social\nand then being able to monitor what's on their site, improve the user\nexperience, you can see that also, for example, with hotels on travel sites\nand so forth. So I think over time, you're going to actually see us build a\nsolid foundation for revenue improvement because we think there's going to be\nbetter conversion. Already, we're seeing traffic in the medical health care\nareas improve as a result of doing this.\n"", ""Yes, Grace, and I think the other question you were asking or you're implying,\nfrom my understanding, is you're comparing us to our peers and you're asking\nus probably on the growth rate. I think in addition to those 3 areas, number\none is our -- we span across many industries. Secondly, I think is the\nstructured data we talked about various ads on our platform that we want to --\nwe've been doing this starting late last year that we want to actually ensure\nthat we have a better user experience. So as a result, it's a matter of\nderisking the properties on Baidu so that in the future we have a more solid\nfoundation to grow. So I think structured data initiative fits into that, and\nthat's probably something that we're doing that a lot of peers are not doing.\nAnd as a matter of fact, by doing this, some of our peers probably would\nbenefit from some of the advertisers that we selectively reject. But what that\nmeans is that you have short-term growth and then you also have a higher risk\nin the future. So we think that, again, our focus right now is how do we\nmaximize our long-term growth, how do we improve the healthiness of our\nadvertising and so forth.\n"", ""Hi Jerry, so a couple questions in terms of are there upsides to the\nindustries specifically for health care and gaming. I think we talked about\nthe health care. I think the key driver there is we switched the majority of\nour medical advertisers at the end of Q1. So in Q2, we're going to have a full\nquarter hit, because typically when you switch those sites, the users come to\nour site, they have to get used to it, and it will take a while for them to\nget used to it to get the conversion to where we are before the switch. And\nthen I think over time, because traffic in this area searches are increasing,\nit shows that user experience are getting better, and we are now getting\nbetter understanding of what the users do after they go to the landing page.\nSo I think over time, using our technology and our experience, we should be\nable to improve conversion. So I think once we can do that, you'll be able to\nsee that growth will come back in health care. With regards to gaming, I think\nyou're right. I think for all the industry-specific policies, it's going to be\nin a similar fashion that once, for example, gaming license you're seeing more\nand more getting approved that's going to cause the game developers to be able\nto develop new games. So whenever they develop new games, they want to launch\nnew games and so forth. I think that revenue is going to come back. The other\nfactors that we talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that there's\ngovernment economic stimulus right now, including a CNY 2 trillion for tax\nbreaks and for other benefits of related costs. So those type of things, we\ndidn't factor in how that's going to impact our business because it's hard to\nquantify, but if those things start to take toll, that is a potential upside.\nWith regards to our cost structure, as I mentioned, we currently plan about\nincreasing CNY 1 billion per quarter for the remainder of the year. What we're\ndoing is going to our businesses to see how much we can reduce that. So I\nthink ultimately, you're probably going to still see a sequential increase,\nbut we would like to not increase at the rate of CNY 1 billion per quarter.\nOkay, I hope that helps.\n"", ""Hi Wendy, that's a mouthful of question there. With regards to health care,\nit's hard for me to predict going into our Q3. So my initial reaction would be\nthat if Q2 is going to have a full quarter impact, we'll probably not going to\nbe able to learn enough about the users and change the user behaviors and so\nforth in just a matter of a couple of months. It probably will take us a\nlittle bit longer. I can't say at this point when that turning point is going\nto be, but I don't think it's going to be a few years, okay? On the other\nhand, with regards to a number of customers, yes, as we're being more\nselective on the quality of our customers, that's going to cause us to\nactually decrease the number of customers for our product health care but I\nthink it's a good thing. As I mentioned, it's a matter of do you want to\nderisk your properties and have a good foundation of the future growth? We've\nalways believed maximizing our future growth is where we want to be. And\nyou're going to some of our peers picking up these probably unhealthy\nadvertisers and probably showing near-term growth. But at the same time, that\ncomes with the risk and regulations and so forth. With regards to are we\nseeing ARPU with our industries and so forth, I think in general, as I\nmentioned, this is a macro impact. So we're seeing ARPU, it depends on which\nindustries, which areas. So it's not, in the past, on a year-over-year basis,\nwe'll probably see ARPU increase across the board. I think this is a quarter,\nespecially when we go into Q2, where it's going to be mixed. It's hard to have\n1 generalization for all the industries. I think right now, with CPM not\ngrowing as fast as we had hoped for after Chinese New Year, then we're going\nto have mixed results across the board. So I think fundamentally, for us what\nwe can control is improve our monetization capabilities to focus on how do we\nbecome better versus our peers. And that's what we've been starting to do.\n""]",Herman Yu,CFO

1,"[""Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today.\n\nIn 2018, we expanded Baidu's business beyond search with AI, by strengthening\nour mobile foundation and leading in new AI businesses, which puts us on\nstrong footing, as we enter 2019. On mobile, the growth rate of Baidu App DAUs\naccelerated over the past year, growing 24% year-over-year to 161 million in\nDecember 2018, compared to a range of 17% to 19% in the past 4 quarters.\nHaokan, our short video app, duplicated Baidu App's search-plus-feed strategy\nand saw its DAUs grow to 19 million in December from 1 million a year ago.\nQuanmin, our flash video app, whose short videos are usually under 1 minute\nlong, saw its DAUs grow to 4 million within 1 quarter of official launch.\nAggregated feed time spent on Baidu, Haokan and Quanmin apps grew 112% year-\nover-year. The robust growth of Baidu's organic traffic is strengthening our\nsearch foundation as well as enabling us to leverage Baidu's AI to become an\nimportant player in feed and short video offerings, which are experiencing\nstrong momentum in China.\n\nOn new AI businesses, DuerOS, we believe, has become the most popular voice\nassistant in China with the largest installed base, reaching 204 million in\nDecember. On product innovation, we launched the first smart display in China,\nXiaodu @ Home, and were the first to introduce a commercial Level 4 vehicle in\nChina, Apolong, with KingLong Automotive. On cloud, we helped enterprise\ncustomers build a competitive edge through Baidu's AI solutions. Enterprise AI\nhas tremendous potential in China by leveraging powerful AI computing, it\ngives China's traditional industries a technological advantage over its\nregional peers.\n\nIn 2018, Baidu reached a historic milestone, with revenues surpassing RMB 100\nbillion. We are excited to pursue the next 100 billion of growth by leveraging\nBaidu's AI to extend beyond search into fast-growing consumer markets as well\nas new AI opportunities in enterprise and government sectors.\n\nLet's begin our Q4 review with search and feed. Our focus in 2018 has been\ninvesting in organic traffic to accelerate our growth and strengthening\nBaidu's content ecosystem to give users a better experience with search and\nfeed. Daily active users on Baidu App, our flagship app, has been accelerating\nover the past year, due in part to the improved search experience and the\nstrength of our feed.\n\nDuring the recent Chinese New Year Gala, the most popular TV show in China,\nBaidu participated in the red envelope giveaway, which turned out to be a\nsuccess. More users now realize that Baidu App is better, safer and more\npowerful, as it integrates search and feed seamlessly and provides a native-\napp-like experience. In the future, we do expect search traffic in the Baidu\nApp to grow much faster than the overall search market.\n\nOver the past year, we have made significant progress in expanding our content\nnetwork on Baijiahao, which now hosts 1.9 million Baijiahao accounts. With\nsignificant coverage of top-tier publishers on Baijiahao accounts, we believe\nBaidu's AI -- we leverage Baidu's AI to push the most relevant content to new\nBaidu App users and make their onboarding experience smoother. We deployed the\nsame methodology to Haokan earlier this year by attracting a large base of\nhigh-quality video content publishers and used the Baidu's AI to enable\nsmoother onboarding for new Haokan users.\n\nAs a result, Haokan was the second fastest-growing app among the top 10 short\nvideo apps in China in terms of DAUs, MAUs and total daily time spent during\nthe 3 months ending December, according to QuestMobile. And the fastest-\ngrowing app over the same period was Quanmin, a short video app that we are\nincubating. Quanmin's DAU grew to 4 million in 1 quarter.\n\nShort video is a growing market in China, and we expect this demand to grow\neven faster with the arrival of 5G. Our foray into short videos is seeing\nstrong results. For example, excluding iQIYI, Baidu distributed over 3.5\nbillion video views daily in December, that's up 56% from last quarter. With\nusers showing insatiable appetite for short videos, we are leveraging Baidu AI\nto better tag the video content and personalize each distribution based on\nuser preferences.\n\nWhereas Baijiahao accounts fulfill our users' demand for feed content, Baidu's\nSmart Mini Program allows them to enjoy native-app experience from our partner\nnetwork of service apps. Through the pull down of the home screen, search\nresults and feed viewing, Baidu App users can access the functionalities of\nour partner apps directly from the Baidu App. We believe the future of mobile\nsearch will shift toward closed-loop, native-app experience from the current\nsearch experience that direct users to HTML5 sites. MAUs of our mini program\nhas grown to 147 million in December, up 30% sequentially. In December, we\nopen sourced Baidu's Smart Mini program to allow our top partners to build\ntheir own mini-program network.\n\nOn monetization, the integration of search and feed in Baidu App brings\ntogether significant synergies. During the quarter, we expanded our optimized\ncost per click, or oCPC, offerings to oCPX. For example, we're now offering\noCPM for impressions and oCPV for video views, which enable feed ads to use\nthe same optimization algorithms. With feed and search under one roof, we are\nseeing customers opting for omni-marketing, which is a powerful marketing\ncampaign, leveraging the reach of search, feed and app-opening interstitial\nads.\n\nOver time, we believe the adoption of Baidu's Smart Mini Program will also be\na revenue driver for us. Early A/B testing indicates that advertisers using\nBaidu's Smart Mini Program are getting better ROI than using HTML5 sites as\nthe landing pages for their advertisements.\n\nTurning to DuerOS voice assistant. DuerOS is gaining strong market adoption,\nwith an installed base reaching 204 million in December, up from 141 million\nin September. Voice queries on DuerOS continue to grow robustly, reaching 1.6\nbillion in December, representing a sequential CAGR of over 100% for the last\n7 quarters.\n\nOur customers want smart devices that understand them better, that provide\nbetter search results and that offer more and better services. As a result, we\nwill continue to make heavy investment in AI to provide best-in-class speech\nrecognition and natural language processing technologies. We have also begun\ntesting the DuerOS skills store, where customers can subscribe to both free\nand fee-based skills. The DuerOS skills store currently offers over 1,000\nskills, such as Douyu live video, Dragonfly FM online radio and CITIC Academy\nonline literature, and has a developer community of 27,000 engineers.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, our first-party smart device sold exceptionally well.\nXiaodu smart speaker was the best-selling smart speaker on JD.com, Pinduoduo\nand Gome.com during the Double 11 event; and Xiaodu @ Home, our smart display,\nsaw unit sales accelerate from previous quarters.\n\nTo expand the use of DuerOS voice assistant in November, we added to our\nlineup of Xiaodu smart devices. Xiaodu Smartphone Car Mount, a smartphone\ncharger under US$ 15 equipped with far-field microphones that enable users to\noperate DuerOS skills, such as Baidu Maps and Phoenix New Media, through\nconversational AI, freeing their hands to allow for safer driving. Stay tuned\nfor new Xiaodu smart devices that we will be launching soon. DuerOS for\nApollo, a version of DuerOS adopted for in-vehicle usage, has already been\npreinstalled in Chery's high-end EXEED cars and will be preinstalled in\nselected models of Ford, Lincoln, Great Wall Motor and Byton cars later this\nyear.\n\nOur goal for DuerOS is not only to make interactions with smart devices\nsimpler, we also see a need from users to be able to switch their skills\ninterchangeably across mobile, home and car. Built into DuerOS for Apollo is a\nskills store that operates mini programs from the Baidu App, which will bring\nconvenience to both our users and the developer community.\n\nIn the hospitality sector, DuerOS now powers Baidu's smart display to provide\npersonal concierge in over 2,000 rooms across a score of hotels in China,\nparticularly 5-star hotels, including the newly opened InterContinental\nShanghai Wonderland.\n\nTurning to Apollo. At CES in Las Vegas last month, we released Apollo v3.5,\nwhich supports autonomous driving on complex urban roads. We also introduced\nApollo Open Road for the developer community and Apollo Enterprise, offering\nsolutions to support commercial production, including DuerOS for Apollo, valet\nparking, assisted highway driving, minibus and intelligent maps.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we added First Automotive Works and Volvo, as Apollo\npartners for commercial production of Level 4 passenger cars. Apollo has\ngarnered over 135 OEMs, Tier 1 parts suppliers and other strategic partners to\ndate, including recent additions of Volkswagen Automotive, China Unicom,\nKalray, Quanta Computer and StarNeto Technology.\n\nBeyond autonomous driving, we are receiving interest from Chinese\nmunicipalities to partner with them and provide smart transportation\nsolutions. With the support of local governments, we see commercial\nopportunities to minimize traffic congestion, reduce air pollution and improve\nroad safety by leveraging Apollo V2X, or vehicle to infrastructure, solutions.\n\nAnd for Baidu Cloud. In December, we open sourced OpenEdge, an edge computing\nplatform that extends Baidu Cloud's data processing and machine learning to\nedge devices. Baidu's OpenEdge has received positive feedback from the\ndeveloper community, reaching #1 on GitHub in the open source edge platform\ncategory shortly after launch and continues to hold the top spot in current\nranking, as of February.\n\nBaidu Cloud is seeing strong growth in both revenue and customer base, and is\nexpanding AI solutions across different industry verticals, such as telecom,\nmanufacturing, financial services and transportation. For example, last\nquarter, we showcased a top telecom operator in China that used Baidu AI\nsolution to power one of their call centers. After initial implementation,\nBaidu AI solution was handling millions of calls per month, and reducing the\naverage customer call time by over 70%. We recently signed with the telecom\ncustomer to expand Baidu AI-powered automated call center solution to power\nseveral more call centers. At the same time, we are receiving interest from\nfinancial institutions as well as airlines to power their customer call\ncenters.\n\nSome investors may wonder how the economics will work for Baidu, as we enter\nenterprise AI. Investing in feed and voice assistant are natural extensions of\nBaidu's search business. As we venture into enterprise AI, we have the\npotential to leverage the same AI to significantly expand Baidu's total\naddressable market into the massive enterprise and government sectors.\n\nIn the case mentioned above, just like the economics of ERP projects, the\neconomics of cloud-enabled AI solutions may have low margins in the beginning,\nbut with each replication, the project margin improves, and our AI solutions\nbecome better with machine learning models and experience accumulated.\n\nTurning to iQIYI. As an entertainment IP powerhouse in China, iQIYI continues\nto see strong subscriber growth, adding 36.6 million subscribers in 2018 to\n87.4 million members. In fourth quarter, Baidu and iQIYI co-launched a hybrid\nOTT TV box with Sichuan Cable TV, enhancing the home entertainment experience\nthrough AI. And this is the second OTT TV box following the release of Gehua\nLittle Fruit earlier this year.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over the Herman to go through the financial\nhighlights.\n"", ""Okay, this is Robin. Let me answer your question. I think it's very obvious\nthat newsfeed is a fast-growing market. Everyone in the Chinese Internet\nlandscape is trying to expand in this direction. And Baidu, obviously, is\nleading -- one of the leaders in this space. And by leveraging our strong\ntechnological capabilities, we are -- we have been able to grow the newsfeed\nbusiness at a very rapid rate. We expect this will -- this trend will\ncontinue. In terms of cost structure, it's basically revenue-sharing structure\nfor the content contributors in our feed systems. So the more we can drive our\nfeed traffic, the better we can monetize and the better the economics will be\nfor the content contributors. So at the end of the day, it's how many users\nyou can reach and how better you can match content with users.\n"", ""Yes. Eddie, that's a great question. As you mentioned, we now have a lot of\nmarketing channels for our advertisers, including newsfeed, search, app\nopening ads, Juping or those off-line ad or screens at public areas. We are\npromoting oCPX, so that advertisers just need to tell us what they care about\nand how do they measure success and we are able to use computer programs to\ndistribute their ad messages. So this has been a very good trend for us\nbecause this can leverage our technological capabilities and improve\nconversion for our advertisers. We devote a very meaningful amount of\nengineering resources to constantly improve the performance of this kind of ad\ndeliveries.\n"", ""Grace, let me answer the first part of your question. I think video is a\nsecular trend that basically impact everyone. The whole world, the whole\nInternet, it's moving from text, to images to video. So it's a very large\nsector. There are lots of things can be done. And I think the innovation has\njust begun. For Baidu, our competitive advantage is that we have the best\nmatching capability between users and the content. So we can distribute the\ncontent more efficiently than everyone else, be it search, newsfeed or short\nvideo feeds. I think we will continue to invest in the marketing and\ndistribution of our short video apps. But in the meantime, I think the -- or,\nat the end of the day, the user experience we can deliver or the matching and\ndistribution capability we have is better than anyone else. That's why we\nshould be able to make the money that we deserves.\n"", ""Yes. I think we have entered a new stage for Chinese Internet, the landscape\nof the -- population or the penetration dividend has gone. The growth -- the\nfuture growth will be driven by technological innovation at least for Baidu.\nFor our core business, both search and feed, we continue to see a lot of room\nto grow and to improve. On the search side, I've mentioned oCPX that will\nautomate ad delivery, and we've -- Herman also mentioned that we are moving\nthird-party websites to hosted ads, where we have more control on the content\nand have better visibility on the conversion. We are developing the smart mini\nprograms that will enable advertisers to deliver a better user experiences and\nthat we are also see strong demand for video content, not only from the feed\nfront but also from the search front. We see video search growing at a very\nfast pace, and we need to develop the technologies that can better understand\nvideo content, so that users will be able to find relevant video content more\neasily.\n"", ""Well, I think it's a little bit early to talk about the advertising market\ntrend after Chinese New Year because Chinese New Year is not 1 day. It's like\na month-long holiday, typically after the Lantern Festival, advertisers\ngradually come back. So it's only a couple of days. It's too early for us to\ntell whether it's different from 2018. And because of the heavy investment we\nare making this year, we do expect that monetization in 2020 will pick up.\n"", 'Yes. The Baidu App is super app, its daily active user of well more than 100\nmillion. And that provides users a chance to spare some time and relax,\nsometimes just to play a few games based on the mini program structure. We\nstarted to roll out the mini games during the Chinese New Year Festival, and\nwe obviously saw very good results, tens of millions of users played this\ngame. From day 1, it has been a profitable business for us.\n']",Robin Li,"Co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer"
2,"[""Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Baidu's fourth quarter and full\nyear 2018 call.\n\nBefore I begin with financial review, let me make a few notes.

Starting on\nJanuary 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, a new revenue accounting standard that\nnets value-added tax from the revenue and cost of revenues lines. To increase\ncomparability with 2018 numbers, 2017 revenue numbers and related metrics,\nsuch as margins, have been adjusted, assuming net of VAT.\n\nWe had a terrific year in 2018. Total revenues grew to CNY 102.3 billion, up\n28% year-over-year, or 31% year-over-year excluding revenue from spinoff\nbusinesses, which were approximately CNY 4.1 billion and CNY 3.1 billion in\n2017 and 2018, respectively. Revenues for Baidu Core reached CNY 78.3 billion,\nup 22% year-over-year, or up 26% year-over-year excluding spinoff revenues.\n\nNon-GAAP net income to Baidu was CNY 23.3 billion, up 35% year-over-year and\nnon-GAAP net margin reached 23%. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Baidu Core\nwas CNY 28.5 billion, up 37% year-over-year and net margins was 36% versus 33%\nlast year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA reached CNY 24.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, and EBITDA\nmargin was 24%. Adjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core grew to CNY 31.5 billion, up\n18% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 40% compared to 42% the\nprior year. Free cash flow was CNY 27.2 billion. Free cash flow generated by\nBaidu Core was strong at CNY 24.9 billion or USD 3.6 billion.\n\nTurning to fourth quarter 2018. Total revenues reached CNY 27.2 billion, up\n22% year-over-year or 28% year-over-year, excluding spinoff revenues, which\nwas CNY 1 billion in Q4 2017. Revenue from Baidu Core grew to CNY 20.5 billion\nor USD 3 billion, up 20% year-over-year, excluding spinoff revenues. Marketing\ncustomers grew over 10% year-over-year, which can be largely attributed to our\nindustry-leading performance-based ad products, like dynamic ads and oCPX, as\nRobin mentioned. We saw strong strength coming from education,\ne-commerce/retail and service customers, which were partially offset by the\nweakness in health care, gaming, real estate and, to a lesser extent,\nfinancial services. The customer sector weakness was mostly impacted by\nindustry-specific policies.\n\nOn the healthcare ads, we successfully rolled out Baidu's new policy to\nrequire healthcare customers in the field of andrology and gynecology to shift\nthe landing pages of their ads to Baidu's content platform. By requiring\nhealthcare marketing customers to place their content in structured-data\nformat on Baidu's platform, which allows for comparison across service\nproviders, site commentary and ratings and other important features, we are in\na better position to monitor the sites of our healthcare customers and weed\nout those that offer questionable services. With Phase 1 of the healthcare\nprovider network transition, we are on track to shift the ad landing pages of\nother healthcare customers this year. The new business model not only would\nimprove the quality of marketing customers and the information on health care\nsites, it would also give us a better understanding of user interests, which,\nover time, would allow us to further improve the navigation and relevancy of\nonline healthcare information in China.\n\nUsing similar technologies, we see an opportunity to build a content vertical\nfor online literature and make it easier for authors to distribute their\nliterary works online and receive revenue share. The online literature market\nin China is shifting toward an ad-supported model versus paid content, which\npresents Baidu with a huge market opportunity, playing to our strength as a\nleading marketing platform.\n\nAnother bright spot in Baidu's Core revenues is our cloud business, which\nreached CNY 1.1 billion revenues in the fourth quarter, more than doubling\nfrom last year.\n\nRevenue from iQIYI reached RMB 7 billion, growing at a robust rate of 55%\nyear-over-year. Membership revenue continued to be strong at -- with 37\nmillion subscribers added in 2018, bringing the total subscribers to 87\nmillion in the fourth quarter, driven by premium content and hot originals,\nlike Tang Dynasty Tour, The City of Chaos and Original Sins. iQIYI is becoming\na strong entertainment IP powerhouse through its relentless effort on -- and\nfocus on originals, on premium content and multiple monetization models of the\nsame IP, such as membership subscription, online games, e-commerce and cross\nlicensing.\n\nTurning to cost of sales. Excluding stock compensation, cost of sales, was CNY\n15.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year. Content cost was up 96% year-over-year to\nCNY 7.3 billion, mainly due to iQIYI's increased investment in content and, to\na much lesser extent, investment in Baijiahao content.\n\nSG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation, were CNY 5.4 billion, up 61%\nyear-over-year, primarily due to the increase in channel and promotional\nmarketing to acquire new users for the Baidu's family of apps. As Robin\nmentioned, time spent for Baidu App, Haokan and Quanmin together grew 112%\nyear-over-year in Q4, which illustrates our ability to convert marketing\ndollars into repeatable traffic.\n\nOur focus to place greater reliance on organic traffic growth means that we\nare shifting our financial model to spending upfront marketing dollars with\nreturns spread out over the life of the users. In other words, revenue from\nchannel spend has a delayed effect, whereas revenue from TAC is reported in\nthe quarter of expense.\n\nIn the first half of 2018, a big part of our marketing expenses were spent on\npromoting the Baidu App. In the second half, Baidu App seeing strong growth,\nour app promotion expanded to other products, such as Haokan short video and\nQuanmin flash video.\n\nOur traffic-acquisition mix, shifting from TAC traffic to organic traffic,\nwill dampen our profit margin in the near future, but with extensive internal\nROI analysis, we believe over the long term, this will strengthen Baidu's\nfoundation in search and feed, especially with users moving toward super apps\nand the increase in popularity of mini programs in China.\n\nTurning to R&D expenses. Excluding stock compensation, our R&D expenses were\nup CNY 3.6 billion, up 19% year-over-year, mainly due to the increase in\npersonnel-related expenses. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter\nwas CNY 2.7 billion. Non-GAAP operating income for Baidu Core was CNY 5.8\nbillion, down 17% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin for Baidu Core\nwas 28%.\n\nIncome tax expense was CNY 484 million. Effective tax rate was 46% compared to\n18% last year, primarily due to iQIYI not being able to recognize tax benefit\nfrom its losses in the current quarter. Non-GAAP net income to Baidu was CNY\n4.6 billion, down 17% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to\nBaidu Core was CNY 6.5 billion, down 1% year-over-year and net margin reached\n31% compared to 36% last year. Adjusted EBITDA was CNY 4 billion and adjusted\nEBITDA margin was 15%. The adjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core was CNY 6.9 billion,\ndown 12% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA margin reached 34%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, cash and short-term investments was CNY 141.5 billion\nor USD 20.6 billion. Excluding iQIYI, cash and short-term investments were CNY\n128.7 billion or USD 18.7 billion.\n\nFree cash flow was RMB 5.9 billion. Free cash flow to Baidu Core was strong at\nRMB 5.5 billion or USD 801 million. And total headcount of Baidu Core was\napproximately 33,700, up 1% year-over-year.\n\nTurning to first quarter guidance. We expect total revenues to be between CNY\n23.5 billion and CNY 24.7 billion, representing a 12% to 18% increase year-\nover-year or 18% to 24% increase year-over-year, excluding spinoff revenues of\nCNY 1.1 billion for first quarter of 2018.\n\nFor 2019 margins, please consider the large marketing campaigns that we did\naround the Chinese New Year time frame, including branding, red-envelope\ngiveaway and so forth. These forecasts are our current and preliminary view,\nand are subject to change. I'll now open the call to questions.\n"", ""Binnie, good morning. As I mentioned in our call, we talked about, you know,\nthere are a few businesses that we'll be focused on going forward that we also\nhave been focused on in the last few quarters. I think the way to look at our\nmargins and our investments are like this. We finished our 3-year plan just in\nJanuary and our plan was to figure out a way to accelerate our revenue growth\nbased on the new markets that we're going after. And the cost driver, I think,\nfor 2019 will be a function of a few factors. I think number one is when you\nlook at, for example, search and feed, our priority would be to grow our\norganic traffic. Although, as I mentioned before for our TAC, as long as\nthere's profit to be made, we'll continue going down that path. But the\npriority I think will be with organic traffic. And that would be a function of\ninvesting in the marketing and content cost. And also it's a function of the\nnumber of apps that we decide to promote. As I mentioned earlier in 2018, at\nthe beginning of the year, we focused on Baidu App. As we got into the second\nhalf, we looked at Haokan. And in the fourth quarter, we also added Quanmin.\nSo that caused our marketing dollars towards the end of 2018 to accelerate. I\nthink going into 2019, you should see us focusing or investing at least in 3\napps and potentially more. Another business that we're very focused on is the\nDuerOS. And I think for that, you can see it's a function of the number of\nproducts that we have, the amount of promotion we have to do for new products\nand also the number of units that we sell. And I think the last set of\ninvestments is in the cloud space. We're seeing cloud doing very well, as\nRobin mentioned. The cloud, given -- it's a function of how we're growing and\npreparing to scale our business for the next year. And it's also a function of\nthe number of lighthouse projects that we have. So with every growth plan, our\nfocus is to also grow revenue. So what we'll be looking at this year is to\nfocus on as we're spending these things, are we getting very positive\noperating metrics? And if so, then we should see revenue growth accelerate in\nfuture quarters. So we'll be looking at the operating metrics first, and then\nwe believe that in following quarters, the revenue growth should come. At the\nsame time, just wanted to note that we're also very diligent in terms of\ncontrolling cost. So if you look at, for example, in 2018, our core business\ngrew 28% excluding divestitures, at the same time, our headcount only grew 1%.\nIn 2019, our cost control policy in the company will be very similar, where\nthere are areas where we're tightening, we're very focused on improving\ngreater efficiency and so forth. Does that help answer your question?\n"", 'Binnie, the question you had was how do we see the newsfeed revenue trending?\n', ""Yes. Let me just add a little, Binnie, on this. As you can see, newsfeed in\nthe beginning was mainly social based and we realized on users coming on and\nacquiring fans and so forth. What you're seeing now is newsfeed is getting to\na place where there are many people that could create content, especially they\ncreate in an organization rather than on an individual basis. So that's why\nyou see Baidu entering at this stage, and we're doing it with Baidu App, and\nwe're also using the same methodology going to video. Because now that the\nlimitation is not about the availability of content because the same person\nwill put the content on different sites. Where Baidu's strength is using our\nAI algorithm, the technology we've built up, to be able to recommend better\nthan everyone else, so that the users are very sticky. That's why we show you\nour time spent. So to answer your question, I think our competition, our\nstrength is the ability to use our AI to recommend better and to get the user\njust to be more sticky. And then I think the content will become a commodity.\nSo in terms of that, I think this year you'll see us probably growing more\nvideo content as we're having a few more video apps that we're pushing.\nWhereas for the nonvideo side, I think that you'll see probably a slower\ngrowth because we have built up library of content from past years and just\nadding incremental new content, which probably would not go as fast for the\nnonvideo side.\n"", 'Yes. As you know, that we operated a number of marketing campaigns around the\nChinese New Year, and the highlight would be that the Spring Festival Gala.\nDuring the whole Chinese Spring Festival period, tens of millions of users\nparticipated in our red packet giveaway activities. And many of them start to\nrealize that the Baidu App is different from the Baidu Search from third-party\nbrowsers. That is, I think, the biggest achievement for us because before\npeople always go to third-party browser and thought they are using Baidu App.\nNow we have the chance to show the users that Baidu App offers better, safer\nand more powerful search and feed capability from our app and the retention\nrate has been very satisfactory. And meanwhile, we also used this opportunity\nto promote our smart display, Xiaodu Zaijia (Xiaodu@Home), and that has also\nbeen very well received and that a lot of users placed the order because of\nthis marketing campaign and the device will be shipped to the users in the\ncoming weeks.\n', ""We have done -- so far, we have done 2 fields. Basically gynecology and also\nto male field and we're in the process of expanding that into other medical\nfields. I think we've seen the initial phase to be very successful, better\nthan our original expectation. We're going to need a couple more quarters to\nroll this thing out. I think the initial is better than our expectation as you\nguys saw it did very well compare to the guidance revenue that we originally\nhad.\n"", ""Greg, yes. For iQIYI is -- Gong Yu mentioned on the call that they see an\nenvironment which the content costs toward the end of last year will start to\nstarted to come down, it's going to take probably a year or so for it to\nactually be reflected on the P&L because it takes time for this content to be\nproduced. In addition to the long form, I think this year, content cost is\nusually 2 types. One is on the nonvideo type, which we've been building\nsignificantly last year, as a result of building of the library of content for\nBaidu App. You saw the Baijiahao content increased pretty significant last\nyear into this year. I think with regards to that piece, you'll see some\nincremental increases but not too significant. But on the other hand, where --\nthis year, our focus is in addition to continue to grow Baijiahao, we're\nlooking at also a different type of video apps, one is flash video, which\nmeans that the videos are usually less than one minute. And the other one, and\nshort video, which is probably three minutes to five minutes, that kind of\nproduct. So that one, we're going to have to continue to ramp up in the\ncontent for these apps in order for – these apps to have more content to grow\nmore users. So you should see us ramping that up.\n"", ""Yes, Grace, with regards to the financial model, you're going to probably see\nthese video apps following the same trajectory that we saw for the Baidu Apps.\nSo in the beginning, we're going to have to acquire content for these apps.\nAnd then more importantly, we're going to have to spend promotions to grow the\nusers. And how much we spent on promotion really depends on the daily analysis\nthat we have on the ROIs, whether each of the inventory spot is getting that\ngood ROI. If we do see it then, we're going to continue to double down. If\nROIs are not good, users are not staying on the apps after they come in, then\nwith that inventory channel, then we will cut off. So it's really a function\nof if we can grow the users and grow users' stickiness.\n"", ""James, yes, good question on 1Q. So we gave you revenues. With regards to\nBaidu Core cost of sales and OpEx, the way I would look at it is that in the\nfirst quarter, as Robin mentioned, we made a huge promotion around Chinese New\nYear and a couple of your days ago, on the Yuanxiao, which is the ending of\nthe Chinese New Year, we also did another promotion on television. So we have\nto consider that cost. So the way I would look at it is when you look at cost\nof sales plus OpEx, we could be increasing on a sequential basis upwards to\nmaybe RMB 1 billion. Where we decide from that 0 to RMB 1 billion will really\ndepends on several factors, which I think we're going to have to wait for a\nfew more weeks to be more precise because there are some activities that we\nhave to see for it to pan out. But I would say on a sequential basis, you'll\nprobably see a growth, it could be up to CNY 1 billion, or it could be less\nthan that.\n"", ""Karen, so the way we look at our business today, we don't look at newsfeed\nversus search. We actually look at the ROI of the app itself. So as Robin\ntalked about how customers are buying omni-marketing, when they do a package,\nthey’re looking at now not only on the search results, they're looking at the\nsame time if the advertising can also work in feed so that when the users --\njust saw their advertising in the feed and they did a natural search - and\nthey actually see this - by being able to see the same ad in different ways is\nactually more effective. So the customers are looking at it that way. It's\nvery hard for us to then be able to decouple. How to allocate the revenue\nbetween search and between feed because there's just value for that synergy.\nSo the way we actually look at it is how do we grow organic growth versus\ninorganic growth. With regards to pricing, we're seeing pricing come down. But\nI don't think it's because of competitive reasons. Our pricing, because we're\nperformance-based, it's really a function of the industry mix that we have. If\nyou look at Baidu's products, whether it's dynamic ads, whether it's oCPX,\nwhether it's action-oriented ads and so forth, we're industry leader. We're\nreally the best-in-class. So I think it's not a function of whether we're\nseeing better effectiveness elsewhere. It's a function of, for example, if you\nhave more gaming revenues, for example, you're going to see higher CPMs, maybe\nyou have other type, for example, e-commerce compared to gaming, you're just\ngoing to see less, i.e. CPMs. So a lot of it has to do with industry mix. And\nthat's why I mentioned on the call, where the industries are increasing, where\nthe industry sectors are decreasing for Q4, so you guys can get a flavour of\nhow that's impacting our business.\n"", ""Yes. Let me add a little bit on that. I think first of all, when you mentioned\nhow our advertising sentiment is before and after Chinese New Year, I think\nthat's probably more relevant in terms of brand advertising business. As you\nknow, in brand advertising business, you usually have the master contract,\nafter the Chinese New Year. So our business with the majority is based on\nperformance-based, as I mentioned earlier. So that way, it really depends on\nour technology, our ability to actually get our marketing customers ROI. So I\nthink one point on that. Secondly, you mentioned how do you see what -- the\nmarketing customer sectors are growing. As I mentioned earlier, in 2018, the\nfourth quarter, the sectors that were strong for us, education, e-commerce and\nretail in general, service, we think that that's going to continue to be a\nstrong sectors for us. With regards to gaming, real estate, financial and so\nforth, I think it's a function of policy changes, as I've mentioned earlier.\nSo if the policies are loosening up, if there are more advertisers coming from\nthese sectors and so forth, we believe we're going to get our share because\nour performance base, I think, it's best-in-class.\n"", ""For question on cloud, how do we see in Q1. We don’t give forward guidance on\na particular set of our business. We normally just look at the business in\nwhole. So I'll be able to talk more about our cloud as we exit Q1. With\nregards to how we differentiate -- as Robin mentioned on his prepared remarks,\ntalking about the AI solutions, really our competitive strength is that the\nBaidu Brain the technology that we have that's powering AI solutions for the\nBaidu cloud. So our ability to grow is to be able to look at the verticals and\nsee where we can provide the AI solutions to the enterprise and to be able to\ngive them more competitive advantage.\n\nWith regards to literature, our strength is in search, the search traffic and\nso forth. So while iQIYI is building their library of content, so forth and\ngrowing, I think they are probably going to be more related to entertainment.\nWhereas for Baidu, we're looking at the total web Internet in China. So they\nwould be a proportion of our overall content and strategy, when you couple of\nthat with the amount of traffic that we have in search. I think we will be\nable to -- really to build a vertical for literature when we look at what\niQIYI has in common in the content that Baidu has access to and then plus the\nsearch traffic that we have to give an overall industry strategy.\n""]",Herman Yu,Chief Financial Officer
3,"[""Good morning, Robin, Herman and Sharon. Thank you for taking my question. I\nhave a question regarding the achievement for the Chinese New Year Gala\npromotion. So any metrics that you could share with us in terms of the total\nnumbers of users that have successfully bind their bank cards to Baidu Wallet.\nWhat is the increase in, let's say, the total real name registration for the\nBaidu App after the Gala? And then any metrics, in terms of increase on the\nusage for the DuerOS smart speaker from prior to the Chinese New Year to now\npost the Chinese New Year.

4,"[""Robin, I heard you mentioned that about omni-marketing in your opening remark.\nAs we add more advertising opportunities into our platform, including mini\nprograms and short video on top of search and newsfeed, what's your vision on\nhow your advertisers using these different solutions going forward? And\nspecifically, how would we prepare our advertising system as well as the sales\nteam for the increasingly complex solutions on our platform?\n"", 'Thank you.\n']",Eddie Leung,Merrill Lynch
5,"[""So I would like to ask about the healthcare advertisement. I'm wondering\nwhether the cleanup process of redesigning medical search have been finalized.\nAnd in terms of the adjustment of structured content, has such adjustment\nalready been truly applied to all relevant verticals?

6,"['So my question is about the content cost. So iQIYI’s earnings call, the\nmanagement has talked about their expectations about long video content cost\nto gradually come down in 2019.

7,"[""My question is about Baidu's short video investments. We can see that Baidu's\nshort video apps have achieved very good growth.

8,"[""And Herman, maybe you can help us maybe crystallize the operating income for\nthe core business in 1Q a little bit here. And given the fact that you talked\nabout your priorities are more on organic growth on apps and also you're going\nto focus on a promotional costs, should we think about maybe a total cost\nbase? How should we think about that relative to 4Q versus 1Q? So for example,\nin 1Q '18 your total cost base step down about 13% sequentially. Is that the\nright way to think about it?\n""]",James Lee,Mizuho Securities
9,"[""So just wondering for fourth quarter 2018, what's the revenue contribution\nfrom mobile newsfeed?

10,"[""I have a quick question, Robin and Herman. If you could just take us through\nwhat you think the organic growth rates are for the overall core business,\nexcluding the near-term corrections that we're seeing because of either macro\nfactors or the adjustments that you're making in specific verticals.

0,"[""Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Baidu's Second Quarter 2018\nCall.\n\nBefore I begin Q2's review, let me make a few notes.\n\nAll monetary amounts in my discussion are in RMB, unless stated otherwise.\n\nTurning on January 1, we adopted ASC 606, a new revenue accounting standard\nthat nets value-added tax from the revenue and cost of revenue lines. To\nincrease comparability with 2018 numbers, 2017 revenue numbers have been\nadjusted net of value-added tax.\n\nWe completed the spinoff of our Global DU business, in addition to Baidu\nDeliveries and Baidu Games, and are in the process of spinning off Du Xiaoman,\nor DXM, our financial services business. For today's discussion on Baidu Core,\nwe have excluded the spun-off and to-be-spin-off businesses, including Du\nXiaoman to give more visibility on the performance of Baidu Core, not\nincluding the spun off in planned-to-spin-off businesses.\n\nWith that, let's turn to Q2. We had another solid quarter in the second\nquarter.\n\nTotal revenues reached RMB 26.0 billion, up 32% year-over-year and non-GAAP\noperating income reached RMB 6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year.\n\nRevenue from Baidu Core, excluding spin offs reached RMB 19.0 billion, up 30%\nyear over year and non-GAAP operating profit of Baidu Core, excluding spin\noffs, reached RMB 7.7 billion with non-GAAP operating margin reaching 41%.In\nthe second quarter, our sales and marketing expenses came in under budget.\nWe're targeting non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter to be several\npoints lower than in the second quarter, assuming we're able to acquire the\ntraffic acquisition and channel pre-installs as planned.\n\nRevenue from announced spin offs was slightly above RMB 1.0 billion in the\nsecond quarter. We expect this portion of the revenue to decline in the\nfuture, upon the completion of each divestiture. For example, in July, we\ncompleted divestiture of Global DU, and as a result, we no longer consolidate\nits revenue. We're providing this level of revenue detail to give investors\nmore visibility to gauge Baidu's revenues post the completion of the expected\ndivestitures.\n\nOur strategy to transform Baidu into an AI-first company to drive synergy and\naccelerate long-term growth, while redirecting management attention and\nresources from non-core businesses to new businesses, is seeing good traction.\n\nIn the second quarter, feed plus AI businesses together made up almost 20% of\nBaidu Core revenue excluding spin offs. Together feed plus AI businesses grew\nover 150% year-over-year, AI is powering search with better user experience\nand continuously increasing Baidu's ad effectiveness. AI is also powering the\ngrowth of feed and new AI businesses, which, we believe, will shift Baidu's\nrevenue structure proportionally to higher-growth areas over time.\n\nBy divesting non-core businesses, we expect the announced spin offs together\nwill generate approximately USD 1.8 billion in cash, which we plan to\nrepurpose for better return on capital.\n\nIn June, we announced a share repurchase program for up to USD 1 billion over\nthe next 12 months. Program-to-date, we have given back to our shareholders\napproximately USD 187 million.\n\nLet me now go through the rest of the financial highlights.\n\nOnline marketing revenues were RMB 21.1 billion, up 25% year-over-year. We had\napproximately 511,000 online marketing customers, up 9% year-over-year, and\nrevenue per customer was approximately RMB 41,200, up 16% year over year.\n\nOther revenues were RMB 4.9 billion, up 75% year-over-year, mainly resulting\nfrom the robust growth in iQIYI membership and other businesses.\n\nRevenue from iQIYI in the second quarter reached RMB 6.2 billion, up 51% year-\nover-year.\n\nCost of sales, excluding stock compensation, in the second quarter was RMB\n12.0 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Content cost in the second quarter was up\n68% year-over-year to RMB 5.2 billion, mainly due to the increased content\npurchases by iQIYI, and for Baijiahao, Baidu's feed content network.\n\nSG&A expenses, excluding stock compensation in the second quarter were RMB 4.2\nbillion, up 56% year-over-year, mainly due to the increase in channel and\npromotional marketing, partly offset by the cutback in Baidu Deliveries and\nO2O promotions.\n\nR&D expenses, excluding stock compensation, in the second quarter were RMB 3.3\nbillion, up 24% year-over-year, mainly due to an increase in personnel-related\ncosts.\n\nOperating income in the second quarter was RMB 5.4 billion, up 29% year over\nyear. Non-GAAP operating income was RMB 6.5 billion, up 31% year-over-year.\nNon-GAAP operating income of Baidu Core, excluding spin offs, was RMB 7.7\nbillion and non-GAAP operating margin for Baidu Core, excluding spin offs, was\n41%.\n\nIncome tax expense in the second quarter was RMB 1.1 billion compared to RMB\n0.6 billion last year. Effective tax rate was 18% compared to 11% last year,\nwhich benefited from the disposal of certain subsidiaries.\n\nNet income attributable to Baidu in the second quarter was RMB 6.4 billion,\nand diluted EPS was RMB 18. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu was RMB\n7.4 billion, up 57% year-over-year, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was RMB 21.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter reached RMB 7.4 billion and adjusted\nEBITDA margin reached 29%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for Baidu Core reached RMB 8.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA\nmargin was 43%.\n\nAs of June 30, 2018, cash and short-term investments was RMB 128.3 billion.\nFor the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was RMB 7.1\nbillion, and capital expenditures were RMB 1.5 billion. Total headcount as of\nJune 30 was approximately 39,700, down 6% year-over-year.\n\nAs of June 30, 2018, excluding iQIYI, cash and short-term investments was RMB\n115.2 billion. For the second quarter, cash flow from operating activities was\nRMB 7.0 billion, and capital expenditures were RMB 1.3 billion. Excluding\niQIYI, total headcount as of June 30 was approximately 32,900, down 9% year-\nover-year.\n\nTurning to third quarter guidance, we expect total revenues to be between RMB\n27.37 billion and RMB 28.77 billion, representing a 23% to 30% increase year-\nover-year. Excluding the impact from announced divestitures, including Global\nDU and Du Xiaoman, Baidu expects revenues to be between RMB 26.56 billion and\nRMB 27.92 billion, representing a 26% to 33% increase year-over-year.\n\nThis forecast is our current and preliminary view and is subject to change.\n\nI will now open the call to questions. Operator, please?\n"", 'So on the SG&A, the majority of the growth year-over-year has been related to\npromotional activities and also channel costs. There were over RMB 100 million\nrelated to a certain bad debt that we had to reserve for, but I think that\nwill be more of a one-off than a continuing item.\n', ""Grace, on your question on second half margin, as I mentioned in the prepared\nremarks, we think that we should see our margin dip several points from second\nquarter. We've been talking about this since the beginning of the year that we\nintend to increase our investments in traffic acquisition. I think that's\nprobably the main line item. In addition to that, we'll also continue to\nincrease our investment in content acquisition, so that our feed can continue\nto be able to acquire traffic and push long tail content. So I think those are\nthe main items that could potentially increase our budget, sales and marketing\nand also cost of revenues in the content line.\n"", ""The question, Juan, on TAC, I think in terms of overall traffic acquisition\ncost, the way we look at it is, on TAC, in the past, we look at trying to get\nabsolute margins -- gross margin from TAC purchases, and we've changed that\nstrategy since the beginning of the year. We believe that maximizing profit\nrather than maximizing margin will be a better strategy, and we've been doing\nthat since the beginning of the year. So to the extent that we think that\nthere is incremental dollars to be had, we'll continue to acquire TAC. With\nthat said, we're also looking at the ROIs coming from TAC versus app downloads\nand trying to grow Baidu App. And so far, we think that we're able to actually\nincrease Baidu App spending, app installs, faster than TAC because we see that\nROI has been more positive. So I think in the last 2 quarters, you're seeing\nus trying to increase our investments in traffic acquisition. TAC we have not\nincreased too significantly. However, under sales and marketing channel cost,\nyou've seen that increase significantly because we've found ways to get pretty\ngood ROI by doing such marketing investments.\n"", '', ""Let me answer your first question on the mobile revenue. So mobile revenue as\na percentage of total was 76.6%. So we were 1% less than last quarter. But\nwhen you compared to last year, we were 72%. So when you look at the last 4\nquarters and so forth, mobile revenue was still growing. So as I mentioned at\nthe question before, I don't think a 1% variation is something to worry about.\nI think, overall, we're seeing, if you look at the last 4 quarters, mobile\nrevenue is actually trending up because fortunately traffic from mobile is\nalso higher.\n"", ""And then the last question with regards to spinoff revenues and margins, I\nthink that question is going to be hard to answer. Really depends on whether\nwe're able to close the deal during the quarter or at the end of the quarter.\nWe presented in our prepared remarks the amount excluding the spinoffs. So the\ndifference you can see what we're estimating. For the announced spinoffs in\nQ3, we're anticipating approximately may be RMB 800 million from the spinoff,\nthat's assuming full quarter of our Du Xiaoman financial services. But should\nwe close this deal beforehand, then obviously, we would only have a portion.\nWith regards to the profitability of the spinoff as a whole, we're seeing\nprofitability, but that is pretty minor compared to all of Baidu. So I think\nafter the spinoff, we would probably lose the revenue between RMB 800 million\nto RMB 1 billion a quarter. And then with regards to profitability, we'll lose\nsome profitability, but it will not be too significant.\n"", ""I'll take that, Alex. When you say core business, I guess, you're meaning\nSearch. Is that correct?\n"", ""Okay. So our Search plus feed, I think, overall, is growing pretty\nsignificantly. We don't really break out in terms of how much of that is\ntraffic, how much of that is clicks. I think it is a mixture. When you're\nlooking at Search in itself, obviously, you're seeing the effectiveness of\nusing different type of AI technologies, coupled with our large pool of data\nto continue to increase the efficiency of Search, that's helping drive our\nrevenue. And then with feed, I think, you're seeing both. You're seeing not\nonly additional traffic, you're seeing increasing user time spent. You're\nseeing us introducing some of the new search products, monetization product\ninto feed. You're also seeing different formats, for example, like AR that's\nhelping drive some of the display ads that we didn't have before. So there are\nseveral dimensions that are driving feeds. With regards to Du Xiaoman -- what\nwas the question, again?\n"", ""Yes. Normally for these business decisions, we will announce it publicly when\nwe have made a decision internally. So thus far, Du Xiaoman is the last one\nthat we have announced, and that's the one that in the process we're spinning\noff.\n"", ""And Piyush, on your question with regards to following up on Alex's question\non Search plus feed. I think the reason why you're seeing on a year-over-year\nbasis that we're slowing down from second quarter is because of the 1 year lap\nfrom last year. If we recall the growth rate of our advertising last year,\n2017, I think, first quarter we were at a negative. Second quarter, we were\ngoing, like, 7% year-over-year. And by third quarter, we significantly\nincreased and we were growing 29%. As you probably know, we had a medical\nsituation back in 2016. And by the third quarter of last year, basically, our\nrevenue started going over 29%. So we have a higher base, obviously, coming\ninto this year. So I think it's that 1 year lap of going to be a more\nnormalized growth rate -- sorry, in third quarter last year, that's causing\nthis quarter to be like this.\n""]",Herman Yu,CFO

2,"[""Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining our call today.\n\nWe had another strong quarter in Q2, with our core business exhibiting robust\nrevenue growth, driven by AI-powered monetization capabilities and Baidu feed\ncontinuing its strong traffic and monetization momentum. Our AI businesses are\nalso gaining strong traction.\n\nEarlier this month, we held Baidu Create, our annual AI developer conference\nin Beijing, which drew over 7,300 developers and partners from around the\nworld. Our goal for Baidu Create is to bring developers together to share\nideas on how they can leverage Baidu's AI to grow their business. I'll further\nelaborate on our announcements at Baidu Create and how we use AI to accelerate\nthe growth of our businesses as we review our Q2 results.\n\nLet's begin the quarter with search and feed. We continue to push the boundary\nof the search experience by fulfilling 37% of search queries with TOP 1\nresults, and 38% through Bear Paw accounts, and over 1/6 of our search page\nviews returning high quality videos.\n\nAt Baidu Create, we announced the launch of Baidu's smart mini program to take\nadvantage of emerging trend in China, where apps with lower frequency are\nconnecting to super apps to bypass the ever rising cost of app preinstalls.\nBaidu's smart mini program is unique. In that, it allows app developers to\nquickly convert another platform’s mini program into Baidu’s. app developers\nhave free access to Baidu's AI capabilities, and once Baidu's open-sourced\nmini program is set up, the app developer can also plug into any third-party\nsuper app in Baidu's network. Baidu's smart mini program offers a seamless\nnative-app experience to other apps, which will extend Baidu's long-tail\ncontent reach and derive better conversion.\n\nIn June, average daily active users of Baidu App reached 148 million, up 17%\nyear over year. Total user time spent on Baidu App grew approximately 30% in\nJune year over year. Feed consumption continued to trend in a healthy manner,\nwith video consumption up 270% year-over-year. We added over 200 MCNs in the\nsecond quarter. For example, People's Daily, a major state-owned news platform\nin China, joined our content network Baijiahao, making over 2,000 media\nsources on its platform, representing over 38,000 Baijiahao (BJH) accounts,\navailable to Baidu feed users. We continue to leverage Baidu's strategic\nadvantage to power our feed algorithms with Baidu's AI and massive long-tail\nuser insight to provide users with more interesting and wider range of\ncontent.\n\nOn the monetization front, Baidu's AI has also been the strategic thrust\nbehind our ad innovation and ad effectiveness, from augmented reality to video\nads to performance-based ads.\n\nDynamic Ads has been a strong revenue driver, incorporating product and user\ndata from our customers. This quarter, we expanded Dynamic Ads to advertisers\nin the education and financial services industry beyond e-commerce, travel,\nauto and real estate.\n\nOptimized cost per click, or oCPC, continue to be an important component of\nrevenue growth, as we expand beyond game developers to financial services,\nreal estate and education.\n\nFor mobile action ads, we expanded beyond enabling users to call and chat with\nthe advertisers directly from the ads on Baidu, to enabling the users to take\nadvantage of an instant coupon or click-to-buy. With strong intent data, Baidu\nis able to continuously provide our customers with these useful, interest-\ngeneration and purchase features, which have generated meaningful lift in\nclick-through-rate.\n\nWe are also seeing good results from Moonrise, Baidu's deployment of deep\nreinforcement learning to improve ad performance. Using deep reinforcement\nlearning, which is rewards-based, linking actions to desired results, Moonrise\ncan suggest better keywords, photos and videos from Baidu's huge content\nlibrary to advertisers and increase conversion and overall ads effectiveness.\n\nBaidu is an early adopter of AI. Together with massive user intent data and\ninterest graphs, we see great opportunities to help advertisers leverage\nBaidu's large traffic, open-platform advantages and highly-effective\nperformance-based ads.\n\nTurning to DuerOS, our IoT operating system, DuerOS, is expanding quite\nrapidly. In June, DuerOS installed base reached 90 million, nearly doubled in\nthe last 6 months. Voice queries on DuerOS in June surpassed 400 million\ntimes, again doubling over a 3-month period. To drive the adoption of DuerOS,\nwe offer third-party tool kits as well as first-party and second-party smart\ndevices. In June, we launched Xiaodu Smart Speaker, which sold out 10,000\nunits within the first 90 seconds went on sale online.\n\nXiaodu Video Smart Speaker, which was launched in April with AINemo, continues\nto sell well and has garnered overwhelmingly positive user reviews. We are\nseeing toddlers as young as 4-year-olds and senior citizens becoming an\nimportant customer base, reflecting the ease of use of conversational AI\npowered by DuerOS.\n\nIn addition to retail, DuerOS is partnering with Intercontinental Hotels Group\nto bring smart rooms to China, where hotel customers can control their rooms\nand learn about hotel information through DuerOS conversational AI.\n\nAside from the hospitality industry, DuerOS is also making inroads in the auto\nindustry, forming partnership with the likes of BMW Group, Daimler AG, Ford\nMotor, Hyundai, KIA, Chery, BAIC and the FAW Group and Byton, to allow car\nowners to activate AI input modalities, such as voice, image and facial\nrecognition and enable closed loop services, including ordering movie tickets\nand booking hotels.\n\nIncidentally, we are seeing fast adoption of voice input in China. Baidu\nMobile Input saw average daily voice input grow almost 150% year-over-year in\nJune and averaged 335 million times per day in the last week of July.\n\nJust like computers and smartphones, software will be a key determining factor\nfor user experience of IoT devices, which means users will want better AI\ninput modality, better search technology and better content ecosystem.\n\nOn Apollo, we are moving at China Speed. Earlier this month, we worked with\nKing Long Motors to launch the first fully autonomous Level 4 minibus,\nApolong, a shuttle bus built without steering wheel. Neolix Technology also\nlaunched an L4 vehicle powered by Apollo – a mini-cart for cargo deliveries\nthis month. We are excited about the commercialization of Apollo-powered\nvehicles, which is a testament to Apollo's comprehensive ecosystem, from AI\ntechnologies to OEM software-to-hardware integration, to Tier 1 parts\nsuppliers to IoV-enabled backend infrastructure.\n\nChina is the largest auto market in the world, with 28.9 million new vehicles\nsold last year, presenting a huge opportunity for Apollo to make driving\neasier and help provide environmental and traffic solutions.\n\nIn March last year, I challenged our team to open source Baidu's autonomous\ndriving platform and release a commercially viable vehicle. Within 16 months,\nour team worked with OEM partners to release two Level 4 vehicles off the\nassembly line, which is not an easy feat in the automotive industry, where\nmanufacturing delays are common. Recently, I post another tough challenge to\nour team, help Baidu users identify quality, reliable natural services.\n\nIn China, there are currently 31,000 licensed hospitals, but no effective\nmechanism to identify those with unscrupulous services. In the past, Baidu\nfocused on banning bad ads. As a major information source in China, I believe,\nwe should use AI and step up efforts to significantly improve the quality of\nmedical content and weed out bad hospitals, even if they are licensed and\noperate within the realm of law. Having access to reliable medical service is\na basic necessity to having a quality of life. Within a year, I challenge my\nteam to come up with a solution to improve trust to online medical information\non Baidu properties.\n\nTurning to iQIYI. iQIYI continues to perform well with strong growth in\nmembership and advertising revenue in Q2. Total subscribing members reached 67\nmillion in Q2, adding a record-high of 29 million subscribing members in the\npast year. Forming a large membership base lays a solid foundation for iQIYIto\npromote its self-produced content. We see iQIYI’s award-winning content\nproduction, coupled with Baidu's huge traffic and technology as a powerful\ncombination in online entertainment. Our shared synergies provide iQIYI with a\nunique advantage, particularly as the fast-growing OTT industry in China\ncontinues to scale and conversational AI receives broader adoption into\nChinese households.\n\nIn summary, we are pleased with the momentum that we have built, moving\nforward an AI-first company. We look forward to further updating you on our\nprogress next quarter.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Herman to go through the financial\nhighlights.\n"", ""Yes. Eddie, on the news feed progress, as I mentioned during the prepared\nremarks, things have been growing very, very quickly. And we have seen growth\nboth in terms of DAUs as well as time spent per user. And the relevancy of\nthose recommended news feed content keep improving. We believe we have the\nbest user experience now. And comparing to most of the other super apps, I\nthink, we are gaining share. But our news feed is designed to enrich peoples’\nlives, not really just help them to kill time. So we want our users to learn\nsomething valuable anytime they come to the Baidu App. And that's why we think\nnews feed is actually a part of our core business, and it's an integral part\nof the search plus feed super app. And we do expect this kind of trend will\ncontinue. And we think our news feed already reaches the largest audience\namong all the comparable products in China. With more than 600 million monthly\nusers for our search product, we still have a lot of room to grow in terms of\nthe news feed product. And on the P2P advertisers, we always had a very tight\ncontrol and high bar for P2P advertisers. We haven't seen any meaningful\nimpact on our revenue as of today, and probably going forward, we wouldn't see\nany meaningful impact either.\n"", ""We always hold a very high standard on our content for news feed. We do not\nwant to give users something that's illegal or something that's on the\nborderline. Again, we want to enrich our users life, and we want our users\nlearn something valuable. So we haven't seen any negative impact over the past\ncouple of quarters because our standards have always been higher.\n"", ""Okay. On the smart mini program, we received overwhelmingly positive responses\nfrom the partners we have contacted with. And our latest version of Baidu App\nalready supports the mini program. It will give users much better experience\nand well drive higher conversion in the future. Right now, some of the\nverticals are already ready, including games and travel-related verticals. And\nwe are implementing other verticals to well continue to evolve very quickly.\nWe have promised to open source this by the end of this year, which means that\nother large apps can just plug into the API and be ready to support all kinds\nof mini programs in the same ecosystem. So we're seeing a very high level of\ninterest, and we're just implementing all kinds of features. We're already\nseeing a number of exemplary partners online, for example, train tickets, the\nconversion rate is much higher than before.\n"", ""On the AI initiatives, both DuerOS and Apollo are growing very, very quickly.\nWe're seeing tremendous growth or adoption rate from the users who use our IoT\ndevices, and we see a lot of OEMs’ strong interest to work with us. But this 2\nbusiness lines are in its very early stage, so we do not exact any meaningful\nrevenue contribution in the coming quarters. But having said that, I would say\nthat these 2 business lines are the most advanced ones among its peers. If\nanyone starts to be able to generate meaningful revenue, we will be the first\none to achieve that goal. Especially for Apollo, I think we enjoy an advantage\nthat the Chinese government is very supportive of this kind of technological\ninnovation and are willing to cooperate on the infrastructure level, which\nmeans that they want to install sensors on the roads, so that cars do not need\nto buy very expensive LiDAR or other type of sensors in order to drive\nautonomously. So we are very excited about the future of these new\ninitiatives. And on the regulatory environment, for both search and news\nfeeds, we have been in existence in the search business for a very long time,\nand we're seeing changes or fluctuations from time to time. And we think we\nare able to cope with that going forward as usual. And news feed, we've also\nbeen operating this for a little more than 2 years. And we are able to\nmaintain a high standard and close dialogue with the regulator. And we do not\nsee anything changing significantly going forward.\n"", ""All right, Juan, I'll answer your short video question and Herman will answer\nthe TAC question. Short video is growing very, very quickly. We're new to this\nbusiness, but we have seen tremendous growth over the past few quarters. And\nvideo content represents well over half of our total news feed content\ndistribution volume. And short video is also very positive to our revenue\ngeneration, which means it actually makes money from day 1 if you look at the\nmonetization capability angle. And in terms of regulations regarding to short\nvideo, I think, it's the same standard with text and images. And we have a\nsophisticated system to identify unwanted content, and we're able to use AI,\nuse machine learning to really filter out those unwanted content and send the\nmost relevant content to our users.\n"", 'Yes. As you know, the Internet population in China is not growing as quickly\nas before, so I think the total pie is not getting much larger. But that\nreally means the technology will play a much more important role, both in\nterms of user experience and in terms of monetization. And regarding to ads,\nwe do see a lot of room in terms of better monetization, technology, including\noCPC and including mini programs. Once the advertisers adopt the mini\nprograms, they should see a much better conversion because the user experience\nis more like a native app instead of just a web page. And user data are\nconnected and the relevancy should be improved. So going forward, over the\nnext few quarters, I think a big revenue driver will be technology innovation\non the monetization front.\n', ""When we think about how to develop our products, we always consider the users’\nneeds first. So we want to try to meet users' needs as quickly as possible,\nproviding the right answer as the #1 result achieves that. And in the\nmeantime, I don't think it will hurt monetization significantly, because in a\nlot of cases such kind of #1 result has commercial values too, and users are\nwell served in the meantime and we can make some money out of it. For example,\nwhen people are looking for airline tickets, the first results get very well\nsatisfying users' needs without them landing on the website, and in the\nmeantime, it has got clear commercial value. So when it comes to the ranking\nof search results, we always think of the users' interest first, and we think\nin the long run, users will come back more often and contribute more time to\nour app, and eventually, we will also be able to monetize the overall user\nbase better.\n"", ""On the DAU and time spent metric, I think, the trend for Q1 and Q2 was very\nconsistent. As you know, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter. So in Q2, if we\ncompare to Q1, the sequential growth is very significant. So it's better to\ncompare Q1 with the year-over-year numbers and Q2 also year-over-year numbers.\nThis numbers, we have said in the last earnings call that both are growing.\nAnd comparing to most of the super apps, we are growing faster than most of\nthem.\n"", 'On the DuerOS, we are still focusing on expanding the installed base and\nimproving user experience. There is a clear path to revenue and profit,\nbecause users will increasingly rely on voice-activated devices for all kinds\nof information, content and services. So eventually, we wouldn’t worry about\nmonetization, but for the next few quarters, we would not think that DuerOS\nwill contribute a significant portion of our revenue.\n', ""Yes. As you know, auto is a huge industry, it involves a lot of ecosystem\npartners, and we're working with many of them on Level 3, Level 4. And we're\nalso working with the government to design better infrastructure or smarter\nroads for autonomous driving. So that's why you see that the Level 4 minibus\nactually launched before any passenger cars with Level 3 technologies. They're\ngoing to be used in designated areas at a slower speed, which will make sure\nthat the safety is not an issue. So the Apollo ecosystem is a very\ncomprehensive one. We will be selling simulation software. We will be selling\nHD maps. We'll be selling ACU, which is Apollo Computing Unit consisting of\nboth hardware and software. We will have solutions for valet parking. And we\nhave a broad spectrum of services offering to our partners. As we move\nforward, we'll be able to monetize from both Level 3 and Level 4, and probably\nsome other related areas.\n""]",Robin Li,"Co-Founder, Chairman, & CEO"
3,"[""I have a question on the core ads growth outlook. If my math is right, I\nthink, the core ads growth rate for third quarter revenue guidance is around\nhigh-teens to mid-20s.

And as a follow-up to\nyour question or topic about #1 kind of results having a better impact, does\nthat mean that the #1 keyword basically gets better pricing?

Second question is on TAC. You mentioned that company will step\nup spending on traffic acquisition for the second half of the year, given that\ntraffic acquisition prices remain pretty high, I wonder whether we're going to\nadjust our OEM traffic acquisition strategy and the measurement of ROI for\ntraffic acquisition going forward?\n""]",Juan Lin,86Research Limited

And also, what's CPC trend for both PC and mobile\nbehind that? And secondly, you disclosed about the Baidu App DAU and user time\nspent year-over-year trend. I just wonder if you can also share a sequential\ntrend or maybe the Q1 data for the DAU and time spent? Lastly, on the spinoff\nbusiness, if my calculation is correct, I think the revenue of the spinoff\nbusinesses Internet financing and Global DU is about RMB 800 million to RMB\n850 million.

0,"[""Thank you, Qi. Hello, everyone. We delivered a solid second quarter and\nfurther drove operational efficiencies on our platform. We further scaled back\nspend for Nuomi and shifted our resources to invest in AI, where R&D is a key\ninvestment area.\n\niQiyi, a strong partner in our ecosystem, performed well and we will work more\nclosely together to leverage the strengths of our platforms. We'll continue to\nextract efficiencies and allocate resources with deliberation and discipline.\n\nAs Qi mentioned earlier, FSG operates very well with its positioning as a\nFinTech service provider. To build the capabilities, we have taken on some\ncredit originations and wealth management assets to gain customer and business\ninsights. It is our plan that we will manage financial services-related asset\nexposure as a portion of our total assets around the current range and we'll\nalso contemplate an appropriate structure that enables FSG to operate with\nindependence and flexibility.\n\nAnd finally, about a month ago, we raised $1.5 billion in a public note\noffering, with cash coming in at the beginning of July. We intend to use the\nnet proceeds from this offering to repay existing indebtedness and for general\ncorporate purposes.\n\nNow moving to the financials. All monetary amounts are in RMB, unless\notherwise noted. For the second quarter, total revenue were CNY 20.9 billion,\nrepresenting a 14% increase from the corresponding period in 2016.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Baidu had approximately 470,000 active online\nmarketing customers, representing a 4% increase compared to the previous\nquarter.\n\nRevenue for online marketing customers was CNY 37,500, a 16.5% increase\ncompared to the first quarter of 2017.\n\nTraffic acquisition cost, as a component of cost of revenue, in Q2 was CNY 2.5\nbillion, representing 11.9% of total revenues compared to 15.9% in the\ncorresponding period in 2016, and 12.9% in the first quarter.\n\nBandwidth costs, as a component of cost of revenue, in Q2 were CNY 1.4\nbillion, representing 6.6% of total revenue compared to 6.3% in the\ncorresponding period in 2016.\n\nDepreciation costs, as a component of cost of revenue in Q2, were CNY 828\nmillion, 4% of total revenue compared to 4.1% last year, same period.\n\nOperational costs, as a component of cost of revenue in Q2, were CNY 1.2\nbillion, representing 5.9% of revenue compared to 5.4% last year in the same\nperiod.\n\nContent costs, as a component of cost of revenue in Q2, were CNY 3.1 billion,\n14.9% of total revenue compared to 9.3% in the corresponding period in 2016.\nThis increase was mainly due to iQiyi's increased content cost.\n\nSG&A expenses in Q2 were CNY 2.9 billion, representing a decrease of 30% from\nthe corresponding period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily\ndue to decreased promotional spending for transaction services.\n\nR&D expenses in Q2 were CNY 3.1 billion, a 27.7% increase over the\ncorresponding period last year. The increase was mainly due to the growth of\nR&D personnel-related expenses.\n\nShare-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating\ncost and expense line items, increased in aggregate to CNY 796 million in Q2\nfrom CNY 401 million in the corresponding period last year. This year-over-\nyear increase was a result of increased share grants to employees.\n\nOperating profits for Q2 were CNY 4.2 billion, representing a 46.9% increase\nfrom the corresponding period in 2016. Non-GAAP operating profit was CNY 5\nbillion, a 53% increase over the corresponding period in 2016.\n\nIncome tax expense was CNY 564 million for the second quarter. The effective\ntax rate was 11.3% compared to 24.8% last Q2. The decrease in the effective\ntax rate was due to preferential tax status that was granted to certain PRC\nsubsidiaries in this quarter of 2017.\n\nNet income attributable to Baidu for Q2 was CNY 4.4 billion, an 83% increase\nfrom the corresponding period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for\nthe second quarter amounted to CNY 11.36 and CNY 11.31, respectively.\n\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q2 was CNY 5.6 billion, a 98%\nincrease year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q2 was CNY\n16.0.\n\nAs of Q2, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of\nCNY 92.2 billion. Net operating cash inflow and CapEx for the second quarter\nwere CNY 6.6 billion and CNY 1.1 billion, respectively.\n\nTotal headcount on a consolidated basis, including invested entities, was\nabout 42,200 as of the end of the second quarter 2017. This represents a\ndecrease of 2.6% as compared to last quarter.\n\nNow let me provide you with our top line guidance for the third quarter of\n2017. We currently expect our total revenues for the third quarter to be\nbetween CNY 23.13 billion and CNY 23.75 billion, representing an annual\nincrease of 26.7% to 30.1%. On an apples-to-apples basis, excluding mobile\ngames from Baidu's financials, the guidance represents a 21 -- 29.1% to 32.6%\nyear-over-year increase. Please note this forecast reflects Baidu's current\nand preliminary view and is subject to change.\n\nI will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead with\nquestions.\n"", ""Hi, Eddie. I'll take the first question. Other revenues, yes, you're correct.\nOther revenues, sequentially have stepped up sizably. The components in there\nincludes, of course, the subscription income that we generate from iQiyi's\npaid membership. There is also financial services income and also cloud\nservice income and also other fee service income related to, for example,\npersonal cloud services. So it's a combination of matters that other revenues\nare growing, and we're very pleased with the progress that we’re making on\nmultiple fronts.\n"", ""And for the search clicks, Chi,last year, our search click grew double-digit.\nAnd for the past quarter, we continue to see double-digit growth on paid\nclicks. So search is very solid. And feed is creating additional advertising\ninventory for an additional revenue source for us. So on both the twin-engine,\non the search and feed side, it's progressing well.\n"", ""Alicia, thank you for the question. You did notice that we had pretty solid\nadditions on the customer front in Q2, and seasonally, we do carry out our\nnational -- nationwide campaign to promote our search and overall data\nservices to our customers. As you note earlier in our prepared remarks, there\nis a rich combination of services that we're building for our customers, and\nwe hope to service our customers with a variety of -- with their variety needs\n-- varied needs, that we can meet their desires. And so we do see last year\ntowards year-end, we implemented stricter rules to have higher standards for\nour customers to qualify to do business with us. And after that exercise,\nwe're building our customer base again. And so we do anticipate our customer\nbase should grow. And because of the rich product portfolio that we offer, we\naim to grow our ARPU as well. With regards to TAC, the traffic acquisition\ncost, you will note that year-over-year, it is a decrease. There are basically\n3 factors driving this change. One is last year, you will recall that we had\ngone through some significant changes, and some lost revenue last year was\nrelated to organic revenues that made our base of last year artificially high.\nThat's one. And at the same time, we are deliberately moving some of the TAC\nresources to support the feed business, and that will gradually ramp up. And\nthe third reason would be a growing contribution on the iQiyi side, which\nnormally would not carry a TAC. And so we do anticipate that the contractual\nand the union network will continue to be very important for us and the TAC,\nwe do manage TAC proactively.\n"", ""Alex, if you recall last year, Q1 was a normal quarter, and Q2 was a little\nbit of noises because of the incident that happened in the middle of the\nquarter. So as we have gone through our customer base and kind of start to\nrebuild, our Q1 is still in the ramp-up stage. And compared to last Q1, which\nis a high rate, I think both on the -- especially on the paid clicks side, our\nyear-on-year number is just as what you noted. But as we continue to build up\nour business, recovering from Q4, Q3 of last year, we do see the whole\nbusiness is on a good trajectory. And the paid clicks is recovering very\nnicely and so that's growing. And overall, I think the paid -- I think the CPC\nis also solid and healthy. And we wanted to really deliver the kind of traffic\nand good ROI to our customers. And the CPC is just a natural fallout of the\ncustomer dynamics right now and also the kind of key words and the bidding\nactivities that's going on.\n"", ""As we mentioned earlier, feed is, on the user front, making great progress,\nand user engagement is also ramping up nicely. And also, on the advertising\nand revenue side, it's contributing more. Sequentially, it grew sizably. And\nwe anticipate feed will continue to contribute increasingly in the overall ad\nspend from our customer. It is -- we do focus very much so this year on the\nuser experience and not very reflexively pushing toward the newsfeed. But it's\ngrowing nicely and the customers' acceptance are pretty good. On the PayPal,\nyes, we entered into a strategic partnership with PayPal. And under the\nagreement, the Chinese consumers will be able to use Baidu Wallet to shop and\npay at PayPal's network. So it offers basically a service solution for many of\nthe Chinese customers traveling overseas, and it's providing a greater choice\nfor international shopping opportunities. It's just one of the features that\nwe offer on Wallet.\n"", ""Within our financial services business, we have some credit business as well\nas wealth management business. So these are basically balance sheet that you\nwould see more material existence. P&L-wise, FSG, the financial services, does\nnot really represent significant P&L items, line items. And their revenue,\nfinancial ad revenue and the cost of funding goes through the operating\nincome. So it's above the -- it's not the interest income or interest expense\nthat you see in other income. It's part of the operational expense and\noperational income.\n"", ""Yes. Hi, Alan. With regards to iQiyi's -- the revenue line as well as the\ncontent cost line, both are tracking very well. iQiyi's performance in\ndelivering revenue, the 2-engine revenue, both advertising as well as\nsubscription revenue, is tracking very well, and is very, very solid and\nstrong. And on the content cost, our guidance provided earlier in the year\ncontinued to hold. We do anticipate that we invest significantly on the\ncontent cost-wise. Quarter-on-quarter, you might see variations because\ncontent cost kicking in depends on when you have the popular show starts to\nget into the audience. So quarter-on-quarter, there might be variances but the\nwhole year's spend is tracking as planned.\n"", 'The tax rate, I did give an indication earlier in the year. It should be in\nthe low 20s. They should still hold. We again have a preferential tax\ntreatment that came through this quarter but the normalized tax rate should be\nin 20s, low 20s.\n', ""Okay. The margin, we did deliver a pretty solid margin this quarter. And you\n-- I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks that we are really driving\nfurther operational efficiency, having a keen focus to direct our resources to\nAI and having high efficiency in other parts of the business. And we dialed\nback again in Nuomi. And so hence, the savings on SG&A related expense. Our\nfocus is to invest in AI capabilities and a lot of that is incremental and is\nR&D focused. So you will see we have an increase in R&D expenses but we do\nhave a year-on-year decrease in SG&A expenses. We'll continue to exercise\ndiscipline as we go forward. We do have resources allocated for -- to support\nour feed product, the feed user coverage. And so second half of the year,\nmaybe slightly more aggressive on the SG&A expenses because we do want to have\nan installation coverage for that. R&D expenses will be a steady, incremental,\nconsistent with the prior practice. For iQiyi's drag, it's in the earnings\nrelease.\n"", ""The Q3 guidance reflects our current best estimate. We mentioned earlier,\nwe're very pleased with our progress on the core search side as well as\niQiyi's performance. So both on search, feed and iQiyi, they're very solid.\nAnd of course, we're also growing our business in the financial services and\nthe cloud business. So that reflects the combined force of all these different\nfronts that is reflected in our Q3 guidance.\n""]",Xinzhe Li,CFO
1,"['Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today\'s call. We delivered solid\nfinancial performance and made some significant announcements and developments\nin the second quarter. The arrival of the AI era creates new exciting\nopportunities for Baidu. With the work that we\'re doing with our core business\nin mobile and the leading AI capabilities that we are applying to autonomous\ndriving, DuerOS, AI cloud and financial services, we have a broader mission\nthan we set out to achieve 17 years ago, when the company was founded.\n\nIn May, we announced a new mission statement to make a complex world simpler\nthrough technology. In order to achieve our mission, we will execute on 2\nstrategic pillars: to strengthen our mobile foundation; and to lead in AI.\n\nAs we reflect on the first half of 2017, we are very pleased with our overall\nprogress. This quarter, in strengthening our mobile foundation, we made\nsignificant improvement in our flagship Mobile Baidu app with version 9.0,\nwhich makes the overall Baidu Search experience more mobile native-app-like\nand is the best way to experience the dual search products of query based\ntraditional search and feed, which we think of as ""query-less search."" We\'ve\nseen strong user adoption for Mobile Baidu, with DAU growing the fastest among\nthe top 10 apps in China from March to June, according to QuestMobile. Feed\nuser adoption has been very strong. Feed daily active users surpassed 100\nmillion this month and the key metrics of volume of content distributed and\nmonthly time spent grew rapidly, reaching new highs.\n\nThrough voice search, we make it more natural for users to express queries. In\nsearch, the large majority of search landing pages now deliver a native-app-\nlike experience, having more than doubled in proportion from the beginning of\nthe year. We also dramatically increased the coverage of richer content such\nas video. Overall, we are laser-focused on user experience.\n\nOur mission in the AI age is very clear, we are open and we are enabling. We\nattract the top human talent to our platform and forge ahead in the AI age. We\nheld our first AI developer conference earlier this month and shared our\nprinciples of open platform and win-win ecosystem with our partners and\ndevelopers. We\'ve made significant progress in autonomous driving by\nofficially launching project Apollo, the first open platform for autonomous\ndriving, attracting over 50 strong partners.\n\nIn DuerOS, we continue to lead the industry in technology and with our large\nand growing ecosystem. In ABC cloud, we are seeing strong momentum in customer\nadditions and revenue, and Baidu FSG, our FinTech platform, is healthy and\ngaining industry recognition, having signed a strategic alliance with the\nAgricultural Bank of China.\n\nEach initiative is available to us because of our AI leadership and each\nrepresents substantial opportunity and has the potential to become a sizable\ncore business for Baidu.\n\nI\'ll now turn the call over to Qi to go through our business progress.\n', ""Regarding to the pricing for the feed product, it's not that directly\ncomparable. Because a lot of our advertisers come from the Phoenix Nest search\nadvertisers, they would use a combination of search and feed to decide how\nmuch they spend and what kind price they pay. So this is quite different from\nthe competitors outside of Baidu. The native experience, I think, overall, we\nare still driving a lot of traffic to third-party websites. And in order to\nprovide the best user experience for search and therefore, for most of the\nwebsites, designed for mobile phones, we need to kind of regulate the format\nand user experience for the third-party websites. I think that's good for the\noverall ecosystem. Even after the new rules and regulations, I think this\nstill gives website owners much more liberty and freedom to do things that\nthey cannot do in other closed ecosystems for mobile phones.\n"", 'Yes, but what kind of competitor you are asking?\n', ""Yes, on the iQiyi subscriber base, it's more than 30 million.

2,"[""Thank you, Robin. Let me now walk you through our operating highlights and\nsome additional details.\n\nOn the current core business front, we are making sustained progress in our\nproduct, in particular Mobile Baidu, which is the mobile app that represents\nour flagship product, with the twin-engine user experience of search and feed.\nTo us, feed is query-less search and it is a great way to extend our offering\nto users on mobile devices.\n\nThere are strong synergies between search and feed to drive further experience\nimprovement, usage and engagement. Earlier this month, we launched Mobile\nBaidu version 9.0, a major update that delivers a much improved user\nexperience across a number of key areas, such as faster load speed, smoother\nnavigation, a cleaner interface and a more mobile native app-like experience\nfor consuming content such as video, literature and music.\n\nAt the same time, we drove strong user adoption of Mobile Baidu in the second\nquarter. Mobile Baidu DAU grew the fastest among the top 10 mobile apps in\nChina from March to June according to QuestMobile.\n\nOn search, we continue to make good progress in improving our overall search\nexperience by making the experience much more mobile-native. For example, in\nMobile Baidu, we shipped a new search UI and a new navigation framework which\nsubstantially increased the percentage of search result landing pages with a\nnative app-like experience as a portion of the total search landing pages to\n85% this month, from 40% at the beginning of the year, through intelligent\nfiltering and advanced presentation technologies. Overall, we're focused on\nusing AI as the fundamental driver to deliver sustained improvement of search,\nenabling a better and a more natural search experience via voice and images as\ninputs, and increasing the coverage of richer content such as video.\n\nOn feed, our product quality and user experience improves at a rapid pace,\nparticularly as we leverage our strengths in AI technologies and our search\ndata assets. Such improvements underpin the strong growth of overall daily\nusers. Our volume of aggregated content consumption and distribution as well\nas user time spent, are reaching historical highs this month. Our feed DAU\nsurpassed 100 million this month, up from 83 million DAU in April, outpacing\nour industry peers.\n\nOn the monetization front, because our search plus feed twin-engine and the\nusage growth in feed, our value propositions to advertisers becomes richer,\nmore diversified and overall, more compelling for both performance and brand\nadvertising. As a result, our customer base is growing at a healthy pace. Over\nthe quarter, we added nearly 20,000 online active customers sequentially\nacross a range of industries, including education, auto, logistics and the\nlocal services.\n\nIn particular, we continue to receive good feedback from our advertisers,\nespecially those who benefit from the comprehensive combination of direct\nresponse search ads and branded feed ads and other branded ad formats. This is\nbecause search and feed ads satisfy distinct advertising needs, and we see\nfeed monetization as fundamentally incremental to search ad-spend of our core\nsearch product.\n\nAdvertisers recognize the value of our platform and we have seen strong\nmomentum in feed monetization, with feed revenue doubling between March and\nJune.\n\nIQiyi plays an increasingly important role in strengthening our overall mobile\nfoundation. Its rich content and strong user base are key pieces to Baidu's\noverall ecosystem. We have made a lot of progress in establishing operational\nsynergies in data and content across iQiyi and other Baidu products to spur\nlong-term growth. In Q2, iQiyi continued its excellent performance and leads\nthe online video industry across multiple key metrics.\n\nIn June, according to iResearch, iQiyi's PC and mobile app daily active users\nreached 75 million and 146 million, respectively, reaching new highs. Monthly\ntime spent on PC and mobile continue to grow, with users spending 124 billion\nminutes on PC and 383 billion minutes on the mobile app, second only to time\nspent on Tencent's Weixin app.\n\nNext, I'll talk about our progress on the second strategic pillar, leading in\nthe AI era. Our focus is to accelerate the commercialization of AI\ntechnologies. Our best strategic path forward is to platformize our AI\ntechnologies, build vibrant ecosystems based on healthy business models and\nsustained win-win with developers and partners.\n\nWe held a very successful AI developer conference on July 5, where we clearly\narticulated our AI platform and ecosystem strategy blueprint. The foundation\nof our AI platform is Baidu Brain plus Baidu ABC Cloud, where Baidu Brain\noffers the most complete and leading AI technology suite to developers,\ncoupled with Baidu ABC's growing set of AI-based industry solutions.\n\nWith nearly 5,000 developers and partners in attendance and wide press\ncoverage, our AI platform and strategy have been positively received by the\nbroad developer and partner community. The strong support from partners and\ndevelopers is key to cementing Baidu's industry-leading position in AI.\n\nAt the conference, we officially launched Apollo 1.0 and unveiled Apollo's\ndetailed technology road map. Apollo is the Android for the auto industry,\nmore open and even more powerful. It enables our partners to go from 0 to 1,\nto quickly assemble their own autonomous vehicles and start their product R&D.\nThe Apollo platform and its ecosystem is architected with a powerful set of\nwin-win principles, with open capabilities and increasingly shared resources\nsuch as precious data resources. Our partners can have access to Apollo's\ngrowing powerful capabilities. They can also contribute to Apollo. The key is\nthe more a partner contributes, the even more outsized benefit the partner\nwill receive from the Apollo ecosystem. As a result, the pace of innovation\nwill continue to accelerate.\n\nWe have seen the industry buy in to our approach. Within the short span of\njust a few months, we have assembled the world's most powerful autonomous\nvehicle ecosystem, with over 50 strong partners, including 13 OEMs, 2 of them\nare world-leading big brands in Daimler and Ford; and world-leading Tier 1\nprovider such as Bosch and Continental, as well as leading AI technology\nproviders such as NVIDIA, Intel and Microsoft.\n\nCurrently, project Apollo is #1 on Github in monthly ranking. At the same\ntime, Apollo creates compelling long-term economic opportunities for Baidu, as\nwe will focus our business model on providing a series of high-value services,\nincluding HD maps, simulation engine, security as well as the connected car\nexperience.\n\nAlso at the conference, we showcased the strong progress we are making with\nDuerOS. It is the natural language-based, human-computer interaction platform\nof the AI era. It is embeddable to every single device on earth and enables\nthem to hear, to understand and to fulfill user's needs. It will become the\nfuture universal gateway to the digital world. DuerOS is leading China's\nmarket because it has developed a skill library of 10 major domains and over\n100 subdomains.\n\nEven more importantly, DuerOS has established the leading ecosystem where we\nhave built close partnerships with over 100 branded major appliances,\nincluding Vivo, Xiaomi, HTC, Midea, Haier, TCL, Lenovo and many others and\nprovide them with end-to-end solutions by working together with chipset\nproviders such as MTK, ARM and Qualcomm, and content providers such as iQiyi\nand Himalaya. We've also announced the acquisition of KITT.AI, a Seattle based\nAI startup that provides industry-leading development tools for natural\nlanguage understanding and voice-based hotwords.\n\nIn the AI era, the future of the cloud industry will be increasingly driven by\nintegrating AI in the big data. We were among the first to spot that trend and\nseize the opportunity to pursue our ABC - AI, big data cloud - strategy by\ndelivering a growing suite of powerful industry vertical AI-based solutions to\npartners and developers, including marketing, media, IoT, video, et cetera. By\nfully leveraging Baidu's AI technology strengths and the vast data assets, our\nABC business is growing very rapidly, securing a growing number of customers.\nFor example, we are working with one of China's top mobile phone manufacturers\nto provide them with a 360-degree solution from marketing, to deep learning,\nto intelligent CDN.\n\nOne of the most promising areas for commercialization of AI technology is\nfinancial services. At the Baidu FSG, our focus is AI-enabled fin-tech, by\nleveraging Baidu's technology strengths and data assets to build a suite of\nleading AI-based FinTech capabilities. Our long-term objective is to build out\na platform that enables Baidu and our partners to provide much more compelling\nfinancial services.\n\nTowards this, we are making very good progress in developing core capabilities\nand growing our businesses, last month, we announced a strategic partnership\nwith the Agricultural Bank of China, one of China's largest banks, to\ncollaborate on building an intelligent bank using AI. At the same time, in\norder to further drive our FSG business, we are beginning the process of\nworking out a future operating structure that allows FSG to operate more\nindependently, to expand into areas that may require domestic licenses and\nenable stronger, long-term growth. There's no specific timetable and structure\ndetermined at this point.\n\nOverall, we are very pleased with our progress in the first half of the year.\nWe look forward to continuing our momentum and strong execution on our\n2-pillared strategy in mobile and AI, to better achieve our mission of making\na complex world simpler through technology.\n\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jennifer to go through the financials.\n"", ""So let me take the second part of the AI questions. With regard to AI as it\napplies to IoT as you asked, our approach is using our DuerOS platform. The\nDuerOS platform will enable each IoT device, particularly intelligent home\ndevices, to be able to listen, to talk, to understand users to provide\nservices. And economically, there's 2 future functions. One is these IoT\ndevices that are enabled by DuerOS, they become the future information entry\npoints. The economics will be very similar to today's search business because\nas long as the people are seeking information, interacting with the\ninformation that represent services, content, knowledge, there will be natural\nexpansion of economics like today's search engine business. That's one. The\nsecond is because DuerOS is a platform that enables devices, there's typical\nwhat's called platform economics. You mentioned per-device licensing, that's\none way to do that. Windows, for example, can do that. Or there's channel\ndistribution economics that's in App Store, there's channel distribution\neconomics. And the third part is future VIGs you can take. For example, like\nApp Store, when you sell content through app stores like our iOS, Apple takes\n30% profit. So DuerOS, in the long run, represents very compelling economic\nopportunities for Baidu. Our focus is really execution, building out our\nproducts, our platforms, a very healthy ecosystem. And there's many, many\nimportant execution paths in front of us over the coming years. We are fully\nprepared, when these economic opportunities become more material, we will be\nable to share future operating metrics when we are ready.\n"", ""Let me take the first part. Jennifer, maybe you'd take the second part. So\nwith regards to synergies between search and feed, we see plenty of\nopportunities to drive those user experience synergies. As a matter of\nprinciple, for each of the vertical segments, whether it's commerce, travel,\nretail services, often human needs can be satisfied by a combination of search\nand the feeds together. For example, in terms of, let's say, travel as\npotential verticals. When you're looking for picking leisure locations, you go\nthrough a planning phase. And in that planning phase, you will do a bunch of\nsearches to find the information. And you also want to receive a set of feeds,\nwith regards to pricing and new offers that are available. But this applies to\npretty much every key verticals where that information matters to our users.\nSo as I said, as a matter of principle, there are systematic synergies to be\nexplored. And our Mobile Baidu is really the flagship contingent product that\nenables us to systematically to explore all those synergies. Particularly I'll\nemphasize our version 9.0. It's a great app. If you haven't used it, I highly\nrecommend that you download and use it. There's a lot of improvements and all\nthe key improvements is enabled from engineering product perspective to drive\nthose synergies across all those verticals. So the fruits will come out over\nthe coming quarters and years as we get into more and more product innovations\non the synergy front.\n"", ""So let me talk about the user trend, particularly on Mobile Baidu, our\nflagship product. The trend is users are increasingly using more and more AI-\nlike search queries; for example, using voice to search queries seek\ninformation; for example, using their cameras to look for information based on\nthe images the camera's taking, so that's an important usage trend. The second\nimportant usage trend is more and more richer type of content is being\nshowcased and presented as compelling product search results. In the past\nquarter, we talked about richer video content. But going forward, our focus is\nto use AI technology as a foundation to continue to drive more compelling and\nnatural search experience so that making much, much easier for people to use\nmobile devices or the capability of the device, voice, camera, location, other\nways. And then the result will be presented in a way that combination of\nricher content and also much native app-like quality of experiences. That's\nthe overarching usage trend. And we fully expect our user engagements will\ngrow as we continue to improve the experience, and that will also continue\nover the coming years.\n"", ""Yes, yes. Let me take that question. So with regard to our core search\nproduct, particularly using AI technology to increase the core aspects of the\nproduct which is relevancy. There's indeed plenty of opportunities to increase\nthe overall relevancy of a search experience, particularly as we increasingly\npersonalize our search processes. One of the important areas we see we can\ngrow, not only the search quality in terms of relevancy but also use that to\nexpand the scope of what search can offer. So search can become more and more\npersonalized over time by using AI as technological foundation to drive those\ngrowths. On the monetization side, indeed, we see headroom by using AI\ntechnologies to continue to improve the economic yield. Particularly by\nleveraging more conversion data, using deep learning. For example, over the\nlast 2 quarters, we actually are able to deliver a meaningful improvement on\nconversion rates. As we all know, search advertising is really conversion\neconomics. Any time you use data and technology to improve conversion, over\ntime, you will be able to deliver more economics. And we do believe that\nopportunity will continue to exist as we continue to drive deeper utilization\nof AI technology and more data access to improve search relevancy and also\nadvertising yield over a period of time.\n"", ""We'll try to -- make sure we do understand the question but sorry to -- would\nit be possible to ask you to maybe just say that again make sure that we give\nyou the right answer.\n"", ""Got it, got it. Let me take that question. So with regards to DuerOS, the\ncompetitive landscape is forming. First there's the -- on the domestic front,\nthere are more traditional voice recognition technology-based companies such\nas iFlyTek. Those are one set of competitors. Baidu's the message is, in many\nways, very apparent because we have not only voice speech recognition\ntechnologies, but we have the entire stack of all the content integrations.\nAnd as well as the cloud platforms that delivers the end-to-end, full packaged\nsolution to our partners. And then there's online companies. They have some\nability to offer similar type of services. On those fronts, DuerOS' advantage\nis also truly substantial because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,\nthere's a few important dimensions we are leading strongly. First is the\nplatform understands much more domains than any other competitors. We have 10\nmajor domains and 100 subdomains. And this is a long-term strength because\nit's one thing to understand the voice to text tokens, it's not -- another\nthing to understand the semantics. In order to understand the semantics of the\nuser sentence, you need the knowledge graph, knowledge, and Baidu has by far\nthe largest knowledge graph in China. We have 100 millions of knowledge nodes\nfor knowledge entities, and then we have more than 10 billion knowledge\nrelationships in our knowledge graph, and it's growing at a very rapid pace.\nAnd that's, by the way, through accumulation of 17 years operating a search\nengine to build that knowledge graph. We believe this is one of the very\nimportant sustained advantages that Baidu DuerOS platform enjoys over the\ncompetition. And also our technology is by far leading strongly. As I\nmentioned, we have more than 100 branded appliances, partners, using our\ntechnology, put into their appliances or devices. So overall, we enjoy very\nlarge positions against domestic competitors. And then international\ncompetitors, for example, let's say Amazon or Apple or Google, there, the\nadvantage is also very apparent because to local -- services have to be\nlocalized. You have to have a strong local language, local content. Again,\nBaidu enjoys overwhelming advantage in understanding Chinese conversations and\nintegrating all the Chinese services content. So overall, in summary, DuerOS\nis very strongly positioned competitively, but we take nothing for granted.\nOur focus is to stay absolutely laser-focused accelerating the pace of\ninnovation, deliver to more and more value to our customers and build up the\nfull ecosystem with more partners on board.\n"", ""I can take the voice question. Terrific question. The simple answer is there's\nhuge opportunity ahead. The fundamental reason isn't just voice as a modality,\nit’s natural language conversation. Because for the first time in our history,\nbecause of AI, every device you do not have to learn. They learn you. You can\ntalk to every device using human language. It understands you. So it's highly\ndisruptive as you mentioned, to all vertical apps, vertical domains. Once our\nusers get used to using Xiaodu as their assistant, DuerOS is a constant\ncompanion that understands users and is able to fulfill users' needs. It can\nchange the landscape. There's a huge set of economic long-term opportunities\nfor Baidu. I mentioned the natural economics that would be search advertising\nlike economics but it can go to all of these verticals as well. It can be\nhuman tasks or it can be particular verticals. So to summarize it, that's why\nwe are so focused on investing in building out substantially leading positions\nfor DuerOS and driving accelerated expansion of our ecosystem and growing our\ninstalled base and growing user active usage so that over time, we can deliver\nreally compelling experience to our users and economically, there's a huge\ndisruptive opportunities for Baidu over the coming several years.\n""]",Qi Lu,"Vice Chairman, Group President and COO"
